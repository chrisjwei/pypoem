    "\n",
    "Something that you can see happening is that a lot of times you'll get the same word rhyming to the same word, which in my honest opinion is just bad poetry. Some improvements we can make to this library is upgrading the resource management so we don't see the same word over and over again. The rhyming scheme is not super accurate but works for most cases. We should also make bookkeeping easier so that you can store other metadata about each line you insert into so you can do stuff like this: https://vimeo.com/165395316 you can check out the code for this here https://github.com/chrisjwei/iacd-final which does not support poem structures, but has a much more developed rhyming algorithm and does everything in memory (SHAMELESS PLUG).\n",

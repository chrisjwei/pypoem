Therefore, it is important to offload data because we cannot reasonably load large amounts of data to memory and expect to be able to parse it through it efficiently (especially in python \\*rolls eyes\\*).

    "\n",
    "Now that we have populated our database with a couple dummy lines, we can try to create a poem.\n",
    "#### C) new_poem\n",
    "This part might be a bit confusing and rightly so since most of the logic is caked into this function. Up until this point, we have created classes to represent poem lines and poems and we've gone through and created a method of storing and accessing these lines. We have also done a little bit of analysis by extracting out rhyme phonemes that simplifies the process of generating a new poem.\n",
    "\n",
    "First we need to understand the two inputs `pattern` and `syllable_ranges`. `pattern` is a string that represents the rhyme structure of our poem. For example, `\"AABBAA\"` corresponds to a poem with six lines, where line 1,2,5,6 rhyme and 3,4 rhyme. `syllable_ranges` provides a range of desired syllable counts for each rhyme group. Continuing our example, `syllable_ranges={\"A\":range(5,10),\"B\":[6,8]}` declares that every entry into group `\"A\"` must have 5-9 syllables and every entry into `\"B\"` must have either 6 or 8 syllables. This design is obviously fairly generalized and is slightly limited, you can redesign this function if you need line by line syllable granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "After calling `new_poem`, the input `pattern` and `syllable_ranges` are checked for consistency. We the count the number of lines we need per pattern domain. We now have two dictionaries that tell us for each pattern group the `requested_count` and `requested_syllable_range`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for each pattern group we query into our database to populate a mapping between each pattern group to a pool of resource groups. We do this by filtering out all lines that do not fall in the `requested_syllable_range` and then grouping the remaining lines by its rhyme column, so all words that rhyme with eachother are grouped together. We then filter out all the groups that do not have a count that satisfies `requested_count`; all the remaining groups are valid candidates for this particular pattern group and we simply select out the rhyme column and save it for later use. If a pattern group's resources cannot be fulfilled, a `ResourceError` will be raised, which the user of our library can handle themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, we randomly select a rhyme group for each pattern group, and for each line within a pattern group, we randomly select a unique line from the assigned rhyme group. We then populate a Poem instance with the selected lines and we have ourselves a poem!"

Some improvements we can make to this library is upgrading the resource management so we don't see the same word over and over again. The rhyming scheme is not super accurate but works for most cases. We should also make bookkeeping easier so that you can store other metadata about each line you insert into so you can do stuff like this: https://vimeo.com/165395316 you can check out the code for this here https://github.com/chrisjwei/iacd-final which does not support poem structures, but has a much more developed rhyming algorithm and does everything in memory (SHAMELESS PLUG).\n",

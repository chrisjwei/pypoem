1
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,380
Look! Over there! Enemy's aircraft!
Over there! Look!

2
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,380
Alert! Be prepared!
Hiroshima will be attacked!

3
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,380
Find shelter!
Find shelter!

4
00:01:49,611 --> 00:01:50,612
Where are you going?

5
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:53,281
Help me!

6
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:54,949
Over here!

7
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,539
Stop! Stop the fire!

8
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,119
Hey, you!

9
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:28,900
Go!

10
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,318
Go!

11
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:34,531
That was a B-29, bub.
There's no outrunning what's coming.

12
00:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,574
Yashida!

13
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,765
Yashida, what are you doing?!
Come here!

14
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,565
Yashida, come here!

15
00:02:42,664 --> 00:02:44,165
You're better off down here.

16
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:46,870
<i>- Yashida!</i>
- Yes, I'll be right there!

17
00:02:46,918 --> 00:02:48,670
I'd hurry if I were you.

18
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:54,986
Run. Now!

19
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,957
Stay down!

20
00:04:54,587 --> 00:04:56,798
No, wait!
No, no. Wait.

21
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:02,303
No. It's not safe.

22
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:08,142
Wake up, wake up, wake up.
Wake up.

23
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:11,312
Where were you?

24
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,358
Nagasaki.

25
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,695
That far back?

26
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:27,662
You're here.

27
00:05:27,829 --> 00:05:28,913
Of course.

28
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,873
Can you stay?

29
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,626
You know I can't.

30
00:05:34,627 --> 00:05:36,796
Jean, I'm so sorry.

31
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:38,214
I know.

32
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:42,009
I'll never hurt you
or anyone ever again.

33
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:43,469
I made a vow.

34
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,055
A solemn vow?

35
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,391
You're making fun of me.

36
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:52,478
It's too late.

37
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,611
No! No, Jean!

38
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:02,196
No, no, no! Please!

39
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:03,448
You can't hide.

40
00:06:03,614 --> 00:06:04,615
No, no, no! Please!

41
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:05,950
You can't hide!

42
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:07,660
No, Jean! No!

43
00:06:08,369 --> 00:06:09,370
No.

44
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,574
Whack all of that on store credit.
Thanks, honey.

45
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:14,495
- Got the arrows?
- Yeah.

46
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,290
Remember the arrows?

47
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,251
Yeah, yeah, Eddie,
we got them!

48
00:08:25,715 --> 00:08:26,716
Yeah!

49
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:30,553
Hey!

50
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,638
What are you doing?

51
00:08:32,805 --> 00:08:34,348
Man, you almost
blew his foot off!

52
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:36,434
You're not a hunter,
are you?

53
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,061
Not anymore.

54
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,455
What the hell?

55
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:58,933
Don't make me do this.

56
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:43,811
It must have been
damn near 12 feet tall.

57
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:47,440
We didn't hear
nothing except twigs.

58
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,191
Then it just came upon us.

59
00:10:50,151 --> 00:10:54,363
It got Riley, just gutted him.
It got Eddie.

60
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:58,993
Ripped through the tent, knocked
over the snowcat like it was a toy.

61
00:10:59,869 --> 00:11:01,912
You the one was attacked
by the grizzly?

62
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,751
I'm the one that survived.

63
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:16,552
I'd like to buy this man a drink.

64
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,347
What's your name, mister?

65
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:32,109
It's Logan.

66
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:37,406
And that's a poison broadhead,
which, last I heard, was illegal.

67
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:51,629
Go ahead,
ask me where I found it.

68
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,556
Ask me.

69
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:04,308
Where did you find it?

70
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:06,477
Well,
funny you should ask.

71
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:08,813
I pulled it out of
the back of a grizzly.

72
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,483
Whoever shot it, didn't
have the wind or the balls

73
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:13,984
to track the animal properly...

74
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,152
and put it out of its misery.

75
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,492
Instead of dropping a lethal
dose of the poison...

76
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:25,579
it bled into the bear, made him
crazy, killed five people.

77
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,414
I don't know what
you're talking about.

78
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,291
Because I don't dip
my arrows in anything.

79
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,503
In that case, you got
nothing to worry about.

80
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:39,593
Damn.

81
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,269
That hurt.

82
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:51,188
Sorry, Jean.

83
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,651
I wouldn't bother with them.

84
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:58,946
Most of them will die soon
anyway, without your help.

85
00:12:59,572 --> 00:13:02,992
Three of them, a week from
now in the same truck.

86
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:23,637
This sword is
hundreds of years old...

87
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:27,182
and was named Danzan by the
first samurai who used it.

88
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:30,185
Danzan means "separator"
in Japanese.

89
00:13:31,604 --> 00:13:36,442
The ideal weapon for separating
head and limb from body.

90
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,077
Whoa!

91
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,204
Like so.

92
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:53,584
I'm parked in back.

93
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,719
Get in.

94
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:17,733
Sorry, it's a rental.

95
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,654
Who are you?

96
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,490
Me? I'm Yukio.

97
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,075
And?

98
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:28,786
I've been trying to find
you for over a year.

99
00:14:29,328 --> 00:14:30,496
Why?

100
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,665
To give you that.

101
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:35,125
My employer
wanted you to have it.

102
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,128
Who's your employer?

103
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:40,339
Master Yashida.

104
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:59,441
He said it belongs to you, and
that he's paying all debts.

105
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,111
Master Yashida is dying.

106
00:15:02,528 --> 00:15:06,115
He wants to say thank you for saving
his life all those years ago.

107
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:08,701
He knows that you are a...

108
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:10,953
busy man.

109
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,623
But he very much wants to
say his goodbye in person.

110
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,709
All right, where is he?

111
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,127
Tokyo.

112
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:20,379
Wait...
I'm not going to Japan.

113
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,048
It would be dishonorable for
you to refuse his request.

114
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:27,302
Well, apologize to Mr. Yashida,
I'm not going to Tokyo.

115
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,013
All right?
I've got things to do.

116
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:30,556
Do not apologize.

117
00:15:30,723 --> 00:15:33,225
It's been an honor just
to meet the Wolverine.

118
00:15:36,311 --> 00:15:38,731
That's not who I am
anymore, you understand?

119
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,734
Interesting.

120
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,696
Why did you go into that bar,
if not to seek justice?

121
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:46,864
- I don't know.
- You don't know.

122
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,240
- No!
- I think you know.

123
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:50,409
- Pull over.
- You are a soldier.

124
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:51,827
No, I'm not. Pull over.

125
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,037
You are a soldier.

126
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,830
Pull over, now!

127
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,331
Now.

128
00:16:00,753 --> 00:16:04,757
You are a soldier, and you
seek what all soldiers do.

129
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,091
And what's that?

130
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:08,761
An honorable death.

131
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:10,137
An end to your pain.

132
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,432
Who says I'm in pain?

133
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:18,771
A man who has nightmares every
night of his life is in pain.

134
00:16:36,455 --> 00:16:37,664
One day.

135
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:41,835
I say goodbye to Mr. Yashida
and I come right back.

136
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,630
Okay.

137
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:53,597
Fifteen hours.
Depending on the wind.

138
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,849
Fifteen hours?

139
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,352
You don't like to fly?

140
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,437
I love it.

141
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,298
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

142
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:30,551
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

143
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:32,469
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

144
00:17:36,557 --> 00:17:38,475
<i>Kuzuri.</i>
What does that mean?

145
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,935
Monster.

146
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,356
No pain?

147
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:48,068
- You have no...
- Oh, yeah. Pain.

148
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,487
Plenty of pain.

149
00:17:54,825 --> 00:17:56,577
How old are you?

150
00:17:57,536 --> 00:17:59,371
It's been a long time.

151
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,082
Many wars.

152
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,293
Understand?

153
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,757
Too many fuckin' wars.

154
00:18:21,435 --> 00:18:22,978
We are almost there.

155
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,898
So, you can see the future?

156
00:18:26,982 --> 00:18:28,942
I can read a map.

157
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:32,696
You said you knew the future
of those assholes in the bar.

158
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,532
I know
they are going to die.

159
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,535
We are all going to die.

160
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:42,206
You said they would die in
the same truck, in a week.

161
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:44,875
If you're right,
that's quite a talent.

162
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:50,214
We don't all have claws.

163
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:56,220
So, do I die on this plane?

164
00:18:57,721 --> 00:18:58,889
No.

165
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,350
Not on this plane.

166
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:28,919
Don't let the lights fool you.

167
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:31,129
These are dark days
in Japan.

168
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,508
Some believe when
Master Yashida got sick,

169
00:19:34,591 --> 00:19:35,759
a shadow fell upon us.

170
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,928
Do you think he's a god?

171
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,390
No. A man.

172
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:43,141
But a great one.

173
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,436
After the war, he helped
rebuild the nation.

174
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,189
And the family business
became Japan's largest.

175
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:52,484
Wow. Did they give you a
little card to memorize?

176
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:56,446
I owe Master Yashida
my life.

177
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:58,532
Don't be a dick.

178
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,090
A lot of guns.

179
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,675
There have been attacks.

180
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,553
Attempted kidnappings.
Attempted assassinations.

181
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,054
By who?

182
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,724
The Japanese mob,
the Yakuza.

183
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:26,601
They've grown strong as the
government has grown weak.

184
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,379
- Hi has a gun.
- He's alright.

185
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,769
- Miss Yukio, he has a gun.
- I told you he's alright.

186
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,857
Hip replacement.

187
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,743
Uh, too small.

188
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:45,787
Too small.

189
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:13,690
Hey.

190
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:16,109
This way.

191
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,528
Who's that?

192
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,618
Shingen,
Master Yashida's son.

193
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:29,247
He's good.

194
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,751
He's all right.

195
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,425
So, what happened
to the badass in boots?

196
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:42,761
Master Yashida is traditional.

197
00:21:42,928 --> 00:21:45,889
One eye on the past
and the other on the future.

198
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:03,907
That's Mariko,
his granddaughter.

199
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:24,302
Mariko.

200
00:22:25,846 --> 00:22:27,389
What's wrong with you?

201
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:39,025
You haven't
answered my emails.

202
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,278
I can't tell you now.

203
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:44,030
Yes, you can.

204
00:22:48,618 --> 00:22:50,537
Who is the caveman?

205
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:53,790
The man Grandfather
wanted me to find.

206
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,169
You can't bring him in
like that.

207
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:09,764
Shizu and Saki are going
to disinfect you.

208
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:12,684
Give you a shave.

209
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:14,352
Like hell they are.

210
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,354
Get in the tub.

211
00:23:16,938 --> 00:23:17,981
Whoa.

212
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,233
Get in the tub.

213
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:22,319
Really?

214
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,324
All right.

215
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,747
Okay. Okay.

216
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:36,733
All right, all right, all right.
I can do that bit.

217
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:48,428
What?

218
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,723
What?

219
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,892
You look nice.

220
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,519
I feel violated.

221
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,315
Prepare two more suppressors f
or Master Yashida.

222
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:02,400
And check his blood pressure.

223
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,627
Yashida-sama.

224
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:27,759
Oh...

225
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:30,220
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

226
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,639
You look the same.

227
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:35,141
But, then,
that is no surprise.

228
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:39,980
Dr. Green.

229
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:42,649
Leave us, please.

230
00:24:43,358 --> 00:24:45,151
Five minutes, no more.

231
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,156
My oncologist.

232
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:51,992
Well done.

233
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:59,749
Oh, forget the etiquette.
I'm past such precautions.

234
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:10,343
For many years I have wanted to
thank you for saving my life.

235
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,846
Yeah, well...

236
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,724
You were kind to me.

237
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:18,601
And you were kind
to many people.

238
00:25:19,269 --> 00:25:21,146
I saw that even
from that well.

239
00:25:40,957 --> 00:25:44,336
The painting is from
the village of my birth.

240
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:49,132
It depicts the bravery and
skill of the Black Clan.

241
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:51,760
Ninja warriors.

242
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,971
They served my family
for seven centuries.

243
00:25:56,681 --> 00:26:00,310
I didn't send for you
only to thank you, Logan.

244
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:03,938
I wanted to repay you.

245
00:26:06,775 --> 00:26:09,652
To offer you something
no one else can.

246
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:13,948
A gift to equal
the life you gave to me.

247
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,825
I don't need anything.

248
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:17,452
Not a thing.

249
00:26:18,161 --> 00:26:20,830
Eternity can be a curse.

250
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:24,709
It hasn't been easyforyou,
living without time.

251
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,629
The losses you
have had to suffer.

252
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:31,049
A man can run out
of things to live for.

253
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,468
Lose his purpose.

254
00:26:33,635 --> 00:26:35,345
Become a ronin.

255
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:39,849
A samurai without a master.

256
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,981
I can end your eternity.

257
00:26:47,816 --> 00:26:49,067
Make you mortal.

258
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:57,033
What they did to me,
what I am, can't be undone.

259
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,161
Yashida Industries
can do anything.

260
00:27:00,829 --> 00:27:05,333
We have reason to believe your
ability to heal can be passed.

261
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,501
Passed?

262
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:08,211
From you to another.

263
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,843
You have struggled
long enough, Logan.

264
00:27:16,344 --> 00:27:17,429
I'm confused.

265
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:21,224
I came here to say goodbye
to a man I once knew.

266
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,101
I am the same man.

267
00:27:23,268 --> 00:27:25,770
I was not ready to die then.

268
00:27:25,937 --> 00:27:28,440
I am not ready to die now.

269
00:27:29,232 --> 00:27:30,442
But you are...

270
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,445
aren't you?

271
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,699
Are you offering to kill me?
No.

272
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,742
Not right away.

273
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:43,580
You can live a long
and ordinary life.

274
00:27:44,205 --> 00:27:46,791
Fall in love,
have a family...

275
00:27:46,958 --> 00:27:48,877
grow old.

276
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,215
And one day,
die an ordinary death.

277
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,054
It can be done.

278
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:05,602
Yeah, look, nice to see you again.
Sorry you got sick.

279
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,813
Please, Logan-san.
I need you again.

280
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,399
I fear for my family.

281
00:28:11,566 --> 00:28:14,068
I fear for everything
I have built.

282
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,440
- Enough.
- Please, Logan-san.

283
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:17,989
- You should leave.
- They're going to kill her.

284
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:18,823
Who?

285
00:28:19,157 --> 00:28:21,284
Mariko,
my grand daughter.

286
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:25,288
She is my treasure.
She must be protected.

287
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:31,252
You don't want
what I've got.

288
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,255
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

289
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:35,840
<i>Kuzuri!</i>

290
00:28:38,885 --> 00:28:42,931
Lord Shingen,
your father is asking for you.

291
00:28:45,016 --> 00:28:46,935
It is time.

292
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,423
Father! Father, father..

293
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,656
I need to speak with my father...

294
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:03,159
before he speaks to Grandfather.

295
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:05,328
He'll talk to you later, Mariko.

296
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:06,996
Father! I need to see you now!

297
00:29:07,205 --> 00:29:08,957
Not now, Mariko!

298
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,464
<i>- Please, father!
- Quiet! </i>

299
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,364
<i>Wait, father.
Plesase,  listen to me.</i>

300
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,364
Not now, Mariko.

301
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,364
- Plese, listen to me, Dad.
- Stop bothering me!

302
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,964
- Please, listen to me.
- I have no time for this.

303
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,764
- Just because Grandfather choosen me...
- I told you, shut up!

304
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,264
You just don't care,
that's why grandfather..

305
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,009
Careful, careful.
It's slippery out here.

306
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,344
Let go.

307
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,265
You about done?

308
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:10,685
Let go of me.

309
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:33,291
He just wanted
to say goodbye, huh?

310
00:30:41,049 --> 00:30:42,383
You two
grew up together.

311
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,218
Yes.

312
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:46,554
But you're not her sister.

313
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:49,057
No.

314
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,562
Master Yashida found me
on a trip to the South.

315
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:58,441
He brought Mariko to see a
factory he was building.

316
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,989
I was digging through the
garbage for something to eat.

317
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,618
So they just took
you home with them?

318
00:31:09,994 --> 00:31:13,331
It was always difficult for
Mariko to make friends.

319
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,134
I'll see to it the plane
is ready in the morning.

320
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,512
Sleep here.

321
00:31:46,322 --> 00:31:49,242
Don't look so sad, Shingen.

322
00:31:50,284 --> 00:31:52,161
I'm still dying.

323
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,206
I'll be in my office
if you need me.

324
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:05,174
There is no easy way to say this.

325
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,972
But then, it's never been
easy for us, has it?

326
00:32:12,223 --> 00:32:14,267
I have tried, father.

327
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,853
You've done the best you can.

328
00:32:26,195 --> 00:32:29,866
You have always been
my assumed successor.

329
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:33,202
So the past few years,
as a test,

330
00:32:33,286 --> 00:32:35,246
I allowed you
more control.

331
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:37,790
It has been an honor.

332
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:41,085
And I now realize
that was a mistake.

333
00:32:42,253 --> 00:32:45,756
You have brought this
company close to ruin.

334
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:52,722
When I die, someone else will
take my place as chairman.

335
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,146
Father, I'm sorry if I
have disappointed you...

336
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,231
Let's not insult
one another.

337
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:06,694
You are not the man
to lead Yashida.

338
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,492
You cannot bring in
someone from the outside.

339
00:33:13,618 --> 00:33:15,786
In that,
you are correct.

340
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:40,019
That will never happen.

341
00:33:52,907 --> 00:33:55,868
<i>Eternity
can be a curse...</i>

342
00:33:56,786 --> 00:33:58,037
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

343
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:01,582
<i>You have no pain, Kuzuri?</i>

344
00:34:01,791 --> 00:34:02,792
How old are you?

345
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:04,919
Interesting offer.

346
00:34:08,798 --> 00:34:11,425
What are you doing
turning the old man down?

347
00:34:12,134 --> 00:34:14,637
I thought you
wanted to be with me.

348
00:34:15,137 --> 00:34:16,097
Come here.

349
00:35:06,897 --> 00:35:07,898
He's dead.

350
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,279
I didn't foresee it.

351
00:36:49,208 --> 00:36:51,711
Who's that?
With Mariko.

352
00:36:51,877 --> 00:36:53,379
His name is Noburo Mori.

353
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:56,132
Minister of Justice,
a rising star.

354
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,884
He's Mariko's fiancé.

355
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,053
You need to bow.

356
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,477
Bow.

357
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,067
Lord Shingen,
this is Mr. Logan.

358
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:17,069
I know who he is.

359
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,363
Your father
was a good man.

360
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:23,200
He would often say
the same about you.

361
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:28,080
But then, he was always
fascinated with your kind.

362
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:34,336
Tell me, why do you think he sent
our little Yukio to fetch you?

363
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:37,757
To say goodbye.

364
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:41,594
And now you have.

365
00:37:42,344 --> 00:37:44,847
Time for you to go
back to your cave.

366
00:38:00,613 --> 00:38:02,948
Anyone else
you want me to meet?

367
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,303
I Pledge to you...

368
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:26,388
Master Yashida...

369
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,558
to be vigilant...

370
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,685
and to dedicate my life...

371
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:33,896
to protect Mariko.

372
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,071
That armor belonged
to Shiruba-Samurai...

373
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:44,532
the Silver Samurai.

374
00:38:44,698 --> 00:38:48,118
It will stand watch
over the old man forever.

375
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:06,470
Logan?

376
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,061
Hey.
Something's not right.

377
00:39:15,855 --> 00:39:17,314
Let go.

378
00:39:44,466 --> 00:39:45,509
Logan!

379
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,805
Logan!

380
00:40:16,332 --> 00:40:17,333
Logan!

381
00:41:57,808 --> 00:41:58,976
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

382
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:02,563
Let's go.
Come on, let's go!

383
00:42:15,993 --> 00:42:17,953
- Yukio!
- Mariko!

384
00:43:07,461 --> 00:43:09,004
Mariko!

385
00:44:00,806 --> 00:44:02,349
Come on.
Let's go, let's go.

386
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:43,849
Here, here! Here!

387
00:44:58,071 --> 00:44:59,239
Move!

388
00:45:00,073 --> 00:45:02,200
In here! Move!

389
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:19,468
Keep moving,
keep moving.

390
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,762
Move!

391
00:45:30,771 --> 00:45:32,439
You're bleeding.
You need help.

392
00:45:32,606 --> 00:45:34,107
Just keep moving.

393
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,118
Thank you for
what you did back there.

394
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:46,870
- Those were Yakuza.
- I'm fine.

395
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:48,705
Why are they after you?

396
00:45:48,872 --> 00:45:51,416
I'm fine. I can make
my way from here.

397
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:55,212
You should go.
Get yourself a doctor.

398
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:45,804
Whoa!

399
00:46:47,013 --> 00:46:48,014
That's nice.

400
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,561
This is one of those
bullet trains, right?

401
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:54,563
I told you I don't
need your help.

402
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,942
So what do they do,
like, 300 miles an hour?

403
00:47:08,118 --> 00:47:09,911
This cowardly attack was...

404
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:12,038
the work of Yakuza thugs.

405
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:16,376
A violent
response to my efforts...

406
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:19,713
to crack down on
organized crime.

407
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:24,718
They exited the North Gate.

408
00:47:24,968 --> 00:47:27,762
She was with the stranger...

409
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,897
Your gaijin friend,
where is he?

410
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,566
Last I saw, he was
protecting your daughter.

411
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:43,653
You are a toy doll.

412
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:46,948
A companion for a child
who has outgrown you.

413
00:47:47,115 --> 00:47:49,326
Keep that in mind.

414
00:48:01,421 --> 00:48:03,840
So, where are we headed,
Mariko?

415
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:09,513
Where are we going?

416
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:13,475
I'm going to the end
of the line.

417
00:48:13,558 --> 00:48:15,894
My family has a home
in the South.

418
00:48:16,436 --> 00:48:17,687
That's stupid.

419
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:21,274
No offense, but they're gonna
know to look for you there.

420
00:48:21,608 --> 00:48:23,443
Not this place.

421
00:48:24,444 --> 00:48:25,779
- But you want to be left alone.
- Yes.

422
00:48:25,946 --> 00:48:27,030
- I understand.
- Do you?

423
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:28,615
Oh, yeah. Trust me.

424
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:29,866
Problem is, if I do that...

425
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,118
I don't think you're gonna live
to see the end of the day.

426
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:39,459
You can't pretend shit isn't
happening when it is, princess.

427
00:48:39,626 --> 00:48:43,380
Unless you want to die. ln that case,
you're playing this perfectly.

428
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,155
Oh... What the hell?

429
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:19,416
Oh...

430
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,678
What the hell is happening?

431
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:21,139
What happened to you?

432
00:52:21,306 --> 00:52:22,932
We get off here.
Let's go.

433
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,810
Just listen to me, will you?
We need to find someplace safe.

434
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:28,772
I don't understand. How do
you know they were Yakuza?

435
00:52:28,938 --> 00:52:30,398
They were the same guys
from the temple.

436
00:52:30,815 --> 00:52:31,900
How do you know
they were after me?

437
00:52:32,066 --> 00:52:33,151
Look, we need to find
someplace safe.

438
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:34,277
We need to get off
the streets.

439
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:36,321
- I don't understand.
- Shut up! Listen.

440
00:52:36,488 --> 00:52:38,907
Do you know this place?
Where's downtown?

441
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:40,617
Straight ahead.

442
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:52,128
So, where's the nice part of town?

443
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:53,588
Another eight blocks
that way.

444
00:52:53,755 --> 00:52:55,799
Good.
We're staying here.

445
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:57,801
Let's go.

446
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,808
This is a love hotel.

447
00:53:04,974 --> 00:53:06,309
A what?

448
00:53:06,476 --> 00:53:08,019
A love hotel.

449
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:11,981
For couples,
understand?

450
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:14,484
Uh... Right.

451
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:16,486
Hey.

452
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:20,824
Uh, two rooms. Adjoining rooms,
on the same floor.

453
00:53:21,032 --> 00:53:23,326
Right next to each other.
Very close.

454
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:25,870
Same floor. Same floor.

455
00:53:44,973 --> 00:53:46,140
What did she say?

456
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:50,186
She has no rooms available
next to each other.

457
00:53:50,353 --> 00:53:55,233
She's asking if we prefer
"the dungeon", "the nurse's office..."

458
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,695
or the "mission to Mars."

459
00:54:14,752 --> 00:54:16,212
This'll do.

460
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:22,427
<i>Lift off! We have a lift off!</i>

461
00:54:22,594 --> 00:54:24,762
Kind of homey, actually.

462
00:54:32,103 --> 00:54:33,771
Where do you plan
on sleeping?

463
00:54:36,566 --> 00:54:37,317
I don't.

464
00:55:12,727 --> 00:55:14,228
That's a lot of blood.

465
00:55:16,898 --> 00:55:19,817
I thought you were
done being the hero.

466
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:23,446
But these guys were...
trying to kill her.

467
00:55:26,199 --> 00:55:28,242
Just let it go.

468
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:31,371
It's not hard to die.

469
00:55:34,165 --> 00:55:36,000
Come to me.

470
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,142
Eh!

471
00:55:53,601 --> 00:55:54,644
Oh.

472
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,277
Logan...

473
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:06,239
You're slipping.

474
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:29,637
Logan...

475
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,562
Kill him already!

476
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:40,690
Wanna say something
before you die, gaijin?

477
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:12,573
This is Mieko from the hotel
and her grandson, Hitoshi.

478
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,325
Is he a doctor?

479
00:58:14,826 --> 00:58:17,161
In a manner of speaking, yes.

480
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,705
He's a veterinarian...

481
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:22,500
student.

482
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,710
Large animal.

483
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,342
Uh... Thanks.

484
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:33,135
Whoa.

485
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:38,391
You may have cut him once or twice
while he was stitching you.

486
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:41,561
Okay, okay, okay.

487
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:51,529
Hey.

488
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,408
Thank you.

489
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:02,790
I never needed this before.

490
00:59:02,957 --> 00:59:05,293
What? Help?

491
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:14,093
That doctor, the one who helped
your grandfather, the blonde.

492
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:15,261
Who is she?

493
00:59:15,428 --> 00:59:18,973
He met her last year when
he was in America for treatment.

494
00:59:19,765 --> 00:59:22,935
Your grandfather told me my
healing could be taken from me,

495
00:59:23,019 --> 00:59:24,061
passed on.

496
00:59:25,897 --> 00:59:28,357
I'm not getting better,
not like before.

497
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:31,485
She did this to me.

498
00:59:42,788 --> 00:59:43,789
Blondie!

499
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,042
Blondie!

500
00:59:50,796 --> 00:59:53,841
How much? How much, yeah?
How much?

501
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:17,323
You kept me waiting two hours.
You have no respect.

502
01:00:17,406 --> 01:00:19,033
So you haven't found them?

503
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:25,247
Don't play with me, bitch.
I could kill you.

504
01:00:25,414 --> 01:00:29,251
If you could make me feel something,
Harada, that would be sublime.

505
01:00:29,418 --> 01:00:31,170
I can slit your
pretty mouth open,

506
01:00:31,253 --> 01:00:33,339
before you open it to
say one more stupid...

507
01:00:35,007 --> 01:00:36,300
Ah...

508
01:00:37,677 --> 01:00:40,554
I asked you to do
one thing, little man.

509
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:42,515
Bring me the mutant.

510
01:00:42,682 --> 01:00:45,559
I don't work for you.
I work for the House of...

511
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,606
You work for Yashida,
I get it.

512
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,528
Yet you cannot
fulfill his dying wish.

513
01:00:56,195 --> 01:00:59,573
My God, if you had any idea
how much you have failed him.

514
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:03,035
Where is Logan?
I am not done with him.

515
01:01:08,874 --> 01:01:10,793
The mutant has powers.

516
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:16,048
He's just a man now.
His flesh is weak now.

517
01:01:16,549 --> 01:01:17,925
I did that.

518
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:20,720
I suppressed his power
so he could be taken.

519
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:24,140
You see, it's me
you should respect.

520
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:31,188
Just find them,
before the Yakuza.

521
01:01:58,841 --> 01:02:00,885
We get off here.

522
01:02:19,987 --> 01:02:21,781
Where are we?

523
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,533
Just outside Nagasaki.

524
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:35,086
This way.

525
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:55,606
This is the guy from
the funeral, the archer.

526
01:02:57,066 --> 01:02:58,901
He was your boyfriend.

527
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:01,153
That's Harada.

528
01:03:02,488 --> 01:03:04,323
We were village
champions that summer.

529
01:03:05,407 --> 01:03:09,411
He with the bow
and me with the knives.

530
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:17,628
Harada and I were
planning to get married.

531
01:03:17,795 --> 01:03:19,380
What stopped you?

532
01:03:19,547 --> 01:03:20,840
Grandfather.

533
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,676
He said we had to wait
until we were at least 15.

534
01:03:31,183 --> 01:03:34,186
From the mountain,
from the sea.

535
01:03:46,198 --> 01:03:49,034
Chopsticks upright
are a bad omen.

536
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:52,037
It resembles incense
at a funeral.

537
01:03:55,583 --> 01:03:58,043
Nothing is without meaning.

538
01:03:59,503 --> 01:04:01,130
So, the other night
at the house,

539
01:04:01,213 --> 01:04:03,591
when you ran out
in the rain...

540
01:04:03,757 --> 01:04:05,926
what did that mean?

541
01:04:07,553 --> 01:04:09,680
My grandfather was dying.

542
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:12,308
You knew he was gonna die.

543
01:04:12,391 --> 01:04:13,517
He'd been sick
for a long time.

544
01:04:13,684 --> 01:04:16,187
It wasn't
his death I feared.

545
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,606
So, what, then?

546
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:22,776
What did he tell you
that night?

547
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:28,699
Mariko, why did your father
hit you?

548
01:04:29,742 --> 01:04:31,285
I was trying to warn him.

549
01:04:31,452 --> 01:04:33,078
About what?

550
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,916
What did your grandfather
tell you?

551
01:04:39,043 --> 01:04:42,254
He told me that...

552
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:48,802
in three days, when
they read his will...

553
01:04:51,138 --> 01:04:55,434
I will become the most
powerful person in Japan.

554
01:04:58,312 --> 01:05:00,064
He gave it all to me.

555
01:05:01,732 --> 01:05:02,900
The company?

556
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:09,114
I didn't want it.

557
01:05:11,242 --> 01:05:13,285
He knew that.

558
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,248
I don't understand
why he gave it to me.

559
01:05:17,748 --> 01:05:20,000
It was all my father
dreamed of.

560
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:23,003
Well, that's why.

561
01:05:27,258 --> 01:05:29,635
What about this fiancé of yours?
Nostromo.

562
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:31,804
Noburo.

563
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:33,639
Does he know about this?

564
01:05:33,806 --> 01:05:35,140
No.

565
01:05:36,517 --> 01:05:38,310
Why are you
marrying him?

566
01:05:38,686 --> 01:05:40,771
He seems like
kind of an asshole.

567
01:05:42,648 --> 01:05:44,984
My father arranged it
last year.

568
01:05:45,484 --> 01:05:46,485
What?

569
01:05:46,652 --> 01:05:49,863
It gives him a better access
to the political theater.

570
01:05:53,325 --> 01:05:56,620
To disobey my father
would be to dishonor him.

571
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:03,919
I don't expect
you to understand.

572
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:08,966
You're not Japanese.

573
01:06:15,347 --> 01:06:19,184
Our island is long and thin.

574
01:06:19,685 --> 01:06:21,854
Trains only run
in two directions.

575
01:06:22,438 --> 01:06:23,856
I assure you
Lord Shingen...

576
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,899
my officers are
making every effort...

577
01:06:26,066 --> 01:06:27,985
Then they're idiots.

578
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:30,070
You've wasted
enough of my time.

579
01:06:30,904 --> 01:06:33,032
I have my father's affairs
to attend to.

580
01:06:35,701 --> 01:06:37,077
Get out and find her!

581
01:06:42,875 --> 01:06:46,045
Tell me you have more promising
news from your contacts.

582
01:06:46,837 --> 01:06:48,797
They open the will
in three days.

583
01:06:49,298 --> 01:06:51,050
We are running
out of time.

584
01:06:52,384 --> 01:06:54,553
Soon, I hope.

585
01:06:55,179 --> 01:06:56,889
I'm sending men
to the South.

586
01:06:57,056 --> 01:06:59,058
That's where
we found the bodies.

587
01:07:10,069 --> 01:07:11,862
<i>If the Yakuza got
into the funeral...</i>

588
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:13,489
<i>they had someone inside.</i>

589
01:07:13,822 --> 01:07:16,158
They'll never find me here.

590
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,994
You're not safe.

591
01:07:20,412 --> 01:07:21,914
I'm coming down there.

592
01:07:22,414 --> 01:07:23,540
They'll follow you.

593
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,753
Please.
Wait a few days.

594
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:29,296
Please. I'm fine.

595
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:31,173
Logan's here.

596
01:07:31,423 --> 01:07:33,425
He's wounded, Mariko.

597
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:36,303
Someone's here.

598
01:07:36,387 --> 01:07:37,096
Mariko?

599
01:07:37,179 --> 01:07:38,171
- I got to go.
<i>- Hallo?</i>

600
01:07:38,222 --> 01:07:39,390
Mariko?

601
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:45,396
A tree fell on the road.

602
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:48,607
The men could use some help.

603
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:22,516
Are you okay?

604
01:08:26,395 --> 01:08:27,271
Tired.

605
01:08:27,855 --> 01:08:29,523
Do you need something?

606
01:08:31,733 --> 01:08:32,734
No.

607
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:42,953
This will help.

608
01:09:34,588 --> 01:09:36,256
It's time.

609
01:09:39,134 --> 01:09:40,135
What?

610
01:09:41,178 --> 01:09:43,889
Please. Take it.

611
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:46,934
Thank you.

612
01:10:05,285 --> 01:10:06,620
No.

613
01:10:08,247 --> 01:10:09,790
Two hands.

614
01:10:10,290 --> 01:10:14,086
Japanese sword
require two hands.

615
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,051
- Like that?
- That's it.

616
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:25,639
It's beautiful, Yashida.

617
01:10:28,559 --> 01:10:29,768
But I can't take it.

618
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:31,562
Please.

619
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:33,939
Thank you.

620
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:41,530
Keep it safe.

621
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,326
Keep it safe for me.

622
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:51,498
Someday,
I'll come get it.

623
01:10:59,172 --> 01:11:01,008
It's time.

624
01:11:47,721 --> 01:11:51,350
I was here
when it happened.

625
01:11:53,852 --> 01:11:56,229
It's how I met
your grandfather.

626
01:11:56,605 --> 01:11:58,690
We hid in there.

627
01:12:00,275 --> 01:12:01,735
I heard the stories.

628
01:12:06,406 --> 01:12:08,033
My grandfather would say...

629
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:11,370
"what happened here was proof that
everything in the world finds peace".

630
01:12:16,083 --> 01:12:18,085
Eventually.

631
01:12:22,422 --> 01:12:24,883
That man can
recover from anything.

632
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:31,473
Maybe you, too.

633
01:12:37,396 --> 01:12:39,564
You don't sleep very well.

634
01:12:39,731 --> 01:12:41,733
You call out in the night.

635
01:12:48,323 --> 01:12:49,616
Who's Jean?

636
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:07,342
We should go back.
There's rain coming.

637
01:13:28,113 --> 01:13:29,656
I'll make tea.

638
01:13:37,789 --> 01:13:39,124
For you.

639
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:16,578
This isn't right.

640
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:33,470
You need this tied
like a proper samurai.

641
01:14:37,474 --> 01:14:39,643
Your grandfather
called me a ronin.

642
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:43,396
A samurai
without a master.

643
01:14:45,273 --> 01:14:48,443
He said I was destined
to live forever...

644
01:14:49,569 --> 01:14:51,988
with no reason to live.

645
01:14:56,952 --> 01:14:58,495
Was he right?

646
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:01,081
Yes.

647
01:15:06,253 --> 01:15:07,963
Still?

648
01:15:57,178 --> 01:15:58,179
Hey.

649
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,724
What are you doing?

650
01:16:05,312 --> 01:16:07,814
This isn't going
to end well.

651
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:14,195
Everyone you love dies.

652
01:16:34,883 --> 01:16:36,885
<i>Kuzuri.</i>

653
01:16:39,012 --> 01:16:40,680
Do you know
what that means?

654
01:16:45,352 --> 01:16:47,187
An animal.

655
01:16:47,354 --> 01:16:52,609
A fierce creature with long
claws and sharp teeth.

656
01:16:54,694 --> 01:16:56,738
It fears nothing.

657
01:16:58,531 --> 01:17:02,577
When I was a girl,
I had nightmares.

658
01:17:03,244 --> 01:17:05,622
I'd wake up and
run to my parents.

659
01:17:06,581 --> 01:17:09,292
My father
would get angry.

660
01:17:13,713 --> 01:17:16,800
"Go back to sleep.
Face your fears."

661
01:17:18,259 --> 01:17:20,762
My grandfather
was different.

662
01:17:21,721 --> 01:17:25,475
He told me stories
about <i>Kuzuri,</i> his friend.

663
01:17:26,393 --> 01:17:29,437
Who he met at the bottom
of a well.

664
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:36,069
He said the <i>Kuzuri</i> was
magical and saved his life.

665
01:17:38,405 --> 01:17:43,743
He said <i>Kuzuri</i> would
protect me, too, as I slept in my bed.

666
01:17:52,961 --> 01:17:54,504
Who's Jean?

667
01:18:02,178 --> 01:18:03,680
Is she like you?

668
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:08,435
What happened to her?

669
01:18:09,769 --> 01:18:11,646
She died.

670
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:20,113
I killed her.

671
01:18:26,786 --> 01:18:28,705
Along with the Kuzuri.

672
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:11,414
Logan.

673
01:19:25,762 --> 01:19:27,680
Mariko?

674
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:31,017
Logan!

675
01:19:31,893 --> 01:19:33,186
Logan!

676
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:35,855
Mariko?

677
01:19:36,523 --> 01:19:37,732
Mariko!

678
01:19:38,525 --> 01:19:40,443
No! Logan!

679
01:19:46,199 --> 01:19:47,367
No!

680
01:19:48,451 --> 01:19:49,285
Logan!

681
01:19:49,911 --> 01:19:50,954
No!

682
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:03,800
Mariko!

683
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:08,596
Logan!

684
01:20:10,223 --> 01:20:11,391
No!

685
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:14,727
Logan!

686
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:17,564
Mariko! Mariko!

687
01:20:17,730 --> 01:20:19,232
Logan!

688
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:40,920
Where are they
taking her?

689
01:20:41,129 --> 01:20:42,797
Where are they
taking her?

690
01:20:42,964 --> 01:20:44,424
Where, you piece of shit?

691
01:20:46,342 --> 01:20:48,928
I no talk, <i>gaijin.</i>

692
01:20:49,596 --> 01:20:51,472
I never talk.

693
01:20:57,937 --> 01:21:00,106
Who hired you?

694
01:21:11,117 --> 01:21:12,994
Uh-oh.

695
01:21:23,296 --> 01:21:24,964
Take me to Noburo.

696
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:27,634
- Logan.
- Take me to him.

697
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:29,802
I need to tell you
something.

698
01:21:29,969 --> 01:21:31,888
Do it. Now.

699
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:53,076
You wait in the car.

700
01:21:53,576 --> 01:21:55,578
- Logan.
- What?

701
01:21:56,412 --> 01:21:58,331
I saw you die.

702
01:21:58,498 --> 01:21:59,999
What?

703
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,251
I saw you die.

704
01:22:02,669 --> 01:22:04,671
When? Just now?

705
01:22:05,129 --> 01:22:06,839
A while ago.

706
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,884
But it's not like
I get a complete picture.

707
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:12,303
More like looking
through a keyhole.

708
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:16,140
But I'm always right.

709
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:20,353
All I can see is one part
of a person's life...

710
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:22,522
their death.

711
01:22:23,231 --> 01:22:25,483
And I saw yours.

712
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,571
So, what did you see?

713
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:35,368
I see you on your back.
There's blood everywhere.

714
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:40,415
You're holding your own
heart in your hand.

715
01:22:42,500 --> 01:22:44,502
It's not beating.

716
01:22:45,336 --> 01:22:46,546
I don't have time
for this shit.

717
01:22:46,921 --> 01:22:50,758
When I was five, I knew how
my own parents would die.

718
01:22:53,094 --> 01:22:56,597
Then I watched it happen
from the back seat.

719
01:22:59,559 --> 01:23:00,727
Look at me.

720
01:23:03,855 --> 01:23:06,566
A lot of people have tried to
kill me, and I'm still here.

721
01:23:07,025 --> 01:23:08,693
Yeah...

722
01:23:08,860 --> 01:23:11,362
but you're different now,
aren't you?

723
01:23:12,113 --> 01:23:14,032
They can hurt you.

724
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,200
They can kill you.

725
01:23:16,367 --> 01:23:18,369
Just wait in the car.

726
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:31,215
- I said, wait in the car.
- You need backup.

727
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:33,259
You're not safe,
not in your condition.

728
01:23:35,261 --> 01:23:37,597
Just think of me
as your bodyguard.

729
01:23:46,606 --> 01:23:48,399
<i>Sexy.</i>

730
01:23:55,448 --> 01:23:57,408
- Come on!
- I'm coming.

731
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:08,920
Okay, round four.
Here we go.

732
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:23,476
Drink for you, my lady.

733
01:24:31,484 --> 01:24:32,568
Get out.

734
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:39,909
Not you.

735
01:24:41,828 --> 01:24:42,995
Now call me old-fashioned...

736
01:24:43,162 --> 01:24:44,705
but I thought
being engaged meant

737
01:24:44,789 --> 01:24:45,998
you were done with
this kind of bullshit.

738
01:24:46,165 --> 01:24:47,542
I am the Minister of Justice.

739
01:24:47,625 --> 01:24:48,918
Do you have any idea
what I could do to you?

740
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:50,962
Really? You're gonna
try and talk tough,

741
01:24:51,045 --> 01:24:52,839
standing there in
your red underwear?

742
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:54,423
You have ten words...

743
01:24:54,674 --> 01:24:56,968
ten words...

744
01:24:57,093 --> 01:25:01,472
to explain to me why you,
the Minister of Justice...

745
01:25:01,639 --> 01:25:04,475
would want your fiancé
killed by the Yakuza.

746
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,144
And if I don't like
what you say,

747
01:25:06,227 --> 01:25:08,855
you are going through
that fucking window.

748
01:25:09,730 --> 01:25:11,816
You don't have the faintest
idea what's going on...

749
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,571
- How many words was that?
- Nine.

750
01:25:16,737 --> 01:25:19,365
Nine.
You have one word left.

751
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:23,035
Really?

752
01:25:23,327 --> 01:25:24,787
Really?

753
01:25:25,121 --> 01:25:26,622
Shingen. Shingen!

754
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,792
Keep going.

755
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,296
Since he got sick...

756
01:25:33,462 --> 01:25:36,966
old man Yashida spent billions
on doctors, healers.

757
01:25:37,133 --> 01:25:39,886
Stockpiling adamantium
at his lab in the North...

758
01:25:40,052 --> 01:25:42,430
secretly trying
to prolong his life.

759
01:25:42,597 --> 01:25:45,725
He brought the company
to the edge of bankruptcy.

760
01:25:45,892 --> 01:25:48,060
He was obsessed
with you.

761
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:51,939
English!

762
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:55,484
Shingen lied,
protected the old man...

763
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:58,821
concealed the debt from
stockholders and the board.

764
01:25:58,988 --> 01:26:01,407
He tried to be a good son
and thought he'd be rewarded.

765
01:26:02,491 --> 01:26:04,619
And then the old man left
everything to his granddaughter.

766
01:26:04,785 --> 01:26:07,330
If Mariko got all that power,
she would dump his ass.

767
01:26:07,496 --> 01:26:08,456
It's true.

768
01:26:08,623 --> 01:26:11,667
Mariko would have never gone
through with the wedding...

769
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:14,337
not once the will
was revealed.

770
01:26:15,129 --> 01:26:16,255
She never took to me.

771
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:19,508
Oh, really?
A class act like you.

772
01:26:20,176 --> 01:26:22,845
Shingen promised me
a fortune for my help.

773
01:26:24,013 --> 01:26:27,600
So, you put a hit on his daughter.
Is that it?

774
01:26:28,684 --> 01:26:30,686
Political careers
don't last forever.

775
01:26:31,479 --> 01:26:32,355
That's right.

776
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,523
Wait! Wait! No!

777
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,443
You wanted the truth.
I told you the truth!

778
01:26:38,361 --> 01:26:40,154
I didn't like it.

779
01:26:40,821 --> 01:26:42,156
Wow.

780
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:45,451
How did you know there's
a pool down there?

781
01:26:45,618 --> 01:26:46,994
I didn't.

782
01:27:03,302 --> 01:27:07,682
Did you know I studied
biology in college?

783
01:27:09,558 --> 01:27:11,018
Genetics.

784
01:27:15,022 --> 01:27:17,483
There are genes
that skip generations.

785
01:27:17,984 --> 01:27:19,777
Recessive genes.

786
01:27:22,613 --> 01:27:23,364
Eyes.

787
01:27:23,364 --> 01:27:24,490
Hair.

788
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,159
Talent.

789
01:27:28,577 --> 01:27:30,037
Temperament.

790
01:27:32,123 --> 01:27:35,418
Not every child
gets the same.

791
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:38,337
My father saw
little of himself in me.

792
01:27:39,463 --> 01:27:41,007
But in you...

793
01:27:41,382 --> 01:27:43,759
he faced a mirror.

794
01:28:03,279 --> 01:28:04,822
How did you
convince my father...

795
01:28:04,989 --> 01:28:06,490
to award you control...

796
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,117
of Asia's largest
corporation?

797
01:28:08,534 --> 01:28:10,036
You've gone insane.

798
01:28:11,537 --> 01:28:13,331
I'm just waking up.

799
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:16,625
If you kill me,
you will lose...

800
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:18,753
what little
honor you have left.

801
01:28:22,506 --> 01:28:23,674
Fear not Marko.

802
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:26,302
I don't want to hurt you.

803
01:28:26,677 --> 01:28:27,803
I want to help you.

804
01:28:28,054 --> 01:28:29,680
Help you end your pain...

805
01:28:29,930 --> 01:28:31,140
what that
mutant stopped you...

806
01:28:31,349 --> 01:28:32,641
from doing last week.

807
01:28:32,850 --> 01:28:35,061
I never wanted
to die, Father.

808
01:28:52,620 --> 01:28:53,871
It's alright, Mariko.

809
01:28:59,085 --> 01:28:59,835
Come with me.

810
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:00,836
What is happening?!

811
01:29:01,128 --> 01:29:03,339
More than
you can imagine.

812
01:29:11,514 --> 01:29:13,265
You.

813
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:15,142
Me.

814
01:29:15,309 --> 01:29:19,021
Sorry to interrupt, but I need
your daughter alive.

815
01:29:19,188 --> 01:29:20,523
What are you?

816
01:29:21,357 --> 01:29:23,776
A chemist, a nihilist...

817
01:29:24,193 --> 01:29:27,655
a capitalist,
a mutation.

818
01:29:31,242 --> 01:29:32,743
A viper.

819
01:30:02,982 --> 01:30:04,817
Where is the security?

820
01:30:24,837 --> 01:30:25,838
Yakuza.

821
01:30:28,465 --> 01:30:29,466
Shingen?

822
01:30:50,070 --> 01:30:51,363
Logan.

823
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:03,542
This. This here.

824
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:05,336
Where is this?

825
01:31:08,589 --> 01:31:10,549
Master Yashida's birthplace.

826
01:31:11,592 --> 01:31:14,386
The company built a facility
into the mountainside.

827
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:19,391
How far?

828
01:31:20,059 --> 01:31:22,645
500 kilometers from here.

829
01:32:29,545 --> 01:32:31,880
I gotta get that
thing out of me.

830
01:32:32,381 --> 01:32:33,340
How?

831
01:32:33,716 --> 01:32:34,883
No, stop, Logan.

832
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:38,053
I saw you die.
I'm never wrong.

833
01:32:38,220 --> 01:32:40,222
- I'm never wrong.
- You're not always right.

834
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:41,598
You didn't know the old man
was gonna bite it.

835
01:32:41,765 --> 01:32:43,684
I saw you die in a room like this
with your heart in your hand.

836
01:32:43,851 --> 01:32:45,728
I can't leave her with
those freaks and killers.

837
01:32:46,020 --> 01:32:49,273
I'm the only chance she's got,
but not with that thing inside me.

838
01:32:49,440 --> 01:32:50,524
You're going to die, Logan.

839
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:52,109
Maybe that's okay.

840
01:32:52,568 --> 01:32:54,403
No, listen to me, Logan!

841
01:32:54,570 --> 01:32:56,572
No, stop. Logan!

842
01:32:57,698 --> 01:32:59,074
You're not gonna want
to watch this part.

843
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:01,744
No! Listen to me!
Please, no!

844
01:33:02,411 --> 01:33:04,955
No, stop.
Listen to me.

845
01:33:06,206 --> 01:33:07,249
Logan!

846
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:17,092
Move!

847
01:33:17,259 --> 01:33:18,761
Stay away from him.

848
01:33:20,137 --> 01:33:21,930
He killed your master.

849
01:33:22,598 --> 01:33:25,309
Put hands on your sister.

850
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:27,436
And now you want him?

851
01:33:30,189 --> 01:33:32,024
Oh, no.
I can't see.

852
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:34,860
You'll always be a beggar.

853
01:33:35,027 --> 01:33:35,944
You're crazy.

854
01:33:44,286 --> 01:33:45,329
Oh, no.

855
01:34:16,527 --> 01:34:17,820
Yukio.

856
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:38,382
Logan!

857
01:34:45,514 --> 01:34:47,683
Logan! Logan!

858
01:34:48,559 --> 01:34:49,685
Logan!

859
01:35:32,019 --> 01:35:34,021
Don't hit my friends.

860
01:35:37,107 --> 01:35:38,192
Where's Mariko?

861
01:35:38,358 --> 01:35:41,195
She's gone.
That Viper bitch took her.

862
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:43,697
It was my father's
obsession...

863
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:47,201
with mutation,
with God's mistakes...

864
01:35:48,702 --> 01:35:52,873
like you and her,
that ruined this house.

865
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:07,531
You tried to kill
your daughter.

866
01:37:10,200 --> 01:37:11,660
Live with that.

867
01:37:26,842 --> 01:37:29,636
What kind
of monster are you?

868
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:32,097
The Wolverine.

869
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:48,447
Hey, come here,
come here. That's it.

870
01:37:49,114 --> 01:37:50,115
I was wrong.

871
01:37:50,741 --> 01:37:52,159
I told you.

872
01:37:52,326 --> 01:37:54,077
Let me have a look at you.

873
01:37:54,953 --> 01:37:56,413
It's nothing.

874
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,249
Hey, thank you.

875
01:38:11,470 --> 01:38:13,764
It's a trap, Logan.

876
01:38:33,408 --> 01:38:35,077
Why have you brought me here?

877
01:38:35,619 --> 01:38:36,953
What are you hiding?

878
01:38:37,287 --> 01:38:38,830
You will soon find out.

879
01:38:40,957 --> 01:38:43,085
Welcome, Mariko.

880
01:38:44,252 --> 01:38:47,422
It's all right, Mariko. She also
serves the House of Yashida.

881
01:38:47,589 --> 01:38:49,007
She serves herself.

882
01:38:49,174 --> 01:38:51,426
She infected Logan.

883
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:52,928
Hmm...

884
01:38:53,178 --> 01:38:54,304
And what about Grandfather?

885
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:56,932
What did you infect him with?

886
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:02,104
I granted
his dying wish.

887
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:04,856
I helped him rest.

888
01:39:06,942 --> 01:39:09,277
Now, it's your turn.

889
01:39:43,103 --> 01:39:45,897
Listen to me, mutant.
She will not be harmed.

890
01:39:47,357 --> 01:39:48,942
She will be fine.

891
01:39:50,068 --> 01:39:52,237
So long as you do your job.

892
01:39:53,196 --> 01:39:56,074
Logan will be here soon,
you should prepare.

893
01:39:56,616 --> 01:39:58,869
It was easy
to lure him here.

894
01:39:59,244 --> 01:40:00,704
It's another thing
to capture him.

895
01:40:00,787 --> 01:40:03,874
We're ready.
He's never faced the Black Clan.

896
01:40:06,585 --> 01:40:07,794
Yes, well...

897
01:40:09,796 --> 01:40:11,965
Dip your arrows in this.

898
01:40:12,674 --> 01:40:14,384
It won't kill him,

899
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:16,970
but it will slow him down.

900
01:40:17,053 --> 01:40:18,180
Keep your potions.

901
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:20,932
He's no challenge for us now.
He's weak.

902
01:40:21,808 --> 01:40:22,893
Okay.

903
01:40:26,188 --> 01:40:27,939
But when you fail...

904
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:30,817
you have this.

905
01:40:48,376 --> 01:40:50,295
Did you have a nice rest?

906
01:40:57,510 --> 01:40:58,762
I don't know
what you said or did

907
01:40:58,845 --> 01:41:00,180
to deceive Harada
or my grandfather...

908
01:41:00,347 --> 01:41:01,765
Now, now, calm down.

909
01:41:01,932 --> 01:41:03,934
Your grandfather
sought me out.

910
01:41:04,351 --> 01:41:06,102
I am the head
of this family now.

911
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:12,943
And why do you
suppose that is?

912
01:41:14,778 --> 01:41:17,739
Why do you think
the old man chose you?

913
01:41:21,034 --> 01:41:22,744
Because you are strong?

914
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,789
Or because you are weak?

915
01:42:20,969 --> 01:42:22,637
I see you've come to fight.

916
01:42:22,804 --> 01:42:23,972
It's pointless.

917
01:42:24,139 --> 01:42:26,474
You're weak.
You're out numbered.

918
01:42:26,641 --> 01:42:30,645
The Black Clan has protected the
House of Yashida for 700 years.

919
01:42:32,105 --> 01:42:33,732
Is that all the men
you brought?

920
01:42:37,068 --> 01:42:38,653
I'm gonna get her.

921
01:42:39,279 --> 01:42:41,281
We are grateful for your
protection of Mariko.

922
01:42:41,448 --> 01:42:44,576
But there is one more sacrifice
you must make for her family.

923
01:42:45,827 --> 01:42:47,996
Go fuck yourself,
pretty boy.

924
01:45:50,011 --> 01:45:51,012
Yukio, run!

925
01:47:03,167 --> 01:47:04,460
Logan.

926
01:48:36,844 --> 01:48:38,262
<i>Logan.</i>

927
01:48:38,388 --> 01:48:39,430
<i>Kayla.</i>

928
01:48:39,555 --> 01:48:40,723
<i>- I love you.
- Kayla!</i>

929
01:48:40,848 --> 01:48:42,183
<i>Logan.</i>

930
01:48:47,146 --> 01:48:48,606
<i>- Logan!
- Mariko!</i>

931
01:48:50,566 --> 01:48:51,567
Jean.

932
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:53,986
<i>Save me.</i>

933
01:49:25,226 --> 01:49:27,186
Stand back.
There is no need.

934
01:49:27,437 --> 01:49:29,313
Where is she?
Where's Mariko?

935
01:49:29,439 --> 01:49:30,440
Where is she?

936
01:49:31,357 --> 01:49:33,526
"Where is Mariko?"

937
01:49:33,693 --> 01:49:35,945
Still pining away?

938
01:49:36,112 --> 01:49:37,947
That's so sweet.

939
01:49:39,073 --> 01:49:40,992
Impressive, no?

940
01:49:41,242 --> 01:49:44,829
He is made of adamantium,
just like you.

941
01:49:55,506 --> 01:49:59,218
Oh, Logan, you know what, I get it.
You're frustrated.

942
01:49:59,385 --> 01:50:01,471
I know she's here.
I want to see her.

943
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:03,806
You want answers.

944
01:50:04,849 --> 01:50:06,058
Yes, I want answers!

945
01:50:06,225 --> 01:50:08,060
I'm sorry,
I wish I could say more,

946
01:50:08,144 --> 01:50:10,021
but I was hired in
part for my discretion.

947
01:50:10,188 --> 01:50:11,063
I'm sure you were.

948
01:50:12,231 --> 01:50:13,399
That...

949
01:50:13,566 --> 01:50:18,321
and a certain talent for combining
biochemistry and metaphysics.

950
01:50:18,863 --> 01:50:21,741
High-grade toxins
are my specialty.

951
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:24,452
It helps to be
genetically immune

952
01:50:24,535 --> 01:50:26,913
to every poison
known to man, as I am.

953
01:50:27,914 --> 01:50:31,876
And immune to the toxin
that is man himself...

954
01:50:33,044 --> 01:50:34,378
as I am.

955
01:50:34,879 --> 01:50:37,215
I'll tell you what,
you twisted mutant bitch...

956
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,675
why don't you
open these bracelets

957
01:50:39,759 --> 01:50:41,677
and we'll see
who's made of what?

958
01:50:46,265 --> 01:50:48,893
The claws.
Now we can begin.

959
01:50:51,562 --> 01:50:53,856
I know you care for him.

960
01:50:54,315 --> 01:50:55,816
You need to let go of that.

961
01:50:56,108 --> 01:50:58,152
You are a Yashida.

962
01:50:58,361 --> 01:51:00,321
She betrayed
my grandfather...

963
01:51:00,780 --> 01:51:02,073
and so have you.

964
01:51:02,740 --> 01:51:03,491
No Mariko.

965
01:51:03,866 --> 01:51:05,701
We grew up together.

966
01:51:05,993 --> 01:51:07,411
You need to trust me.

967
01:51:08,538 --> 01:51:10,373
Let me go to him!

968
01:51:10,540 --> 01:51:13,000
He saved my life!

969
01:51:13,209 --> 01:51:15,545
Let him go, Mariko!

970
01:51:15,920 --> 01:51:17,004
This isn't easy
for me but...

971
01:51:17,338 --> 01:51:20,216
I'm following
Grandfather's wishes.

972
01:51:20,299 --> 01:51:23,761
The suppressant bug you found
inside of you was mine.

973
01:51:24,136 --> 01:51:26,681
You took it out
on your own.

974
01:51:27,682 --> 01:51:29,684
I didn't see that coming.

975
01:51:30,059 --> 01:51:31,519
The Viper woman is evil...

976
01:51:31,686 --> 01:51:33,479
we both know that.

977
01:51:33,646 --> 01:51:36,440
But she's a means
to an end...

978
01:51:36,857 --> 01:51:37,775
Where is she?

979
01:51:37,900 --> 01:51:39,569
An end your
grandfather wanted.

980
01:51:39,652 --> 01:51:40,778
You are strong.

981
01:51:41,153 --> 01:51:42,822
You have courage.

982
01:51:43,531 --> 01:51:44,865
Real courage.

983
01:51:48,536 --> 01:51:51,330
But that won't
help much now.

984
01:52:04,677 --> 01:52:05,803
What the...?

985
01:52:06,679 --> 01:52:08,264
You need to trust me.

986
01:52:08,889 --> 01:52:10,182
Is that hard?

987
01:52:10,891 --> 01:52:13,519
We were meant
to be together.

988
01:52:14,020 --> 01:52:16,022
We still can be.

989
01:52:17,023 --> 01:52:18,399
Perhaps.

990
01:52:47,303 --> 01:52:48,095
Stop!

991
01:52:54,393 --> 01:52:55,561
This is madness.

992
01:53:01,233 --> 01:53:02,318
Let's go.

993
01:53:05,237 --> 01:53:06,238
Go!

994
01:53:07,323 --> 01:53:08,324
Run!

995
01:53:21,754 --> 01:53:23,255
Come on.

996
01:53:38,938 --> 01:53:40,314
Mariko, come!
Go! Run!

997
01:53:59,625 --> 01:54:01,043
Mariko, get out!

998
01:55:12,114 --> 01:55:13,491
Ahhh!

999
01:56:49,962 --> 01:56:51,088
Come on.

1000
01:56:51,922 --> 01:56:53,132
This is not the way.

1001
01:57:06,604 --> 01:57:08,147
Two hands.

1002
01:57:12,610 --> 01:57:13,736
Master...

1003
01:57:21,994 --> 01:57:24,121
Hey! Bub!

1004
01:57:43,849 --> 01:57:44,642
Harada.

1005
01:57:51,315 --> 01:57:52,858
I'm sorry.

1006
01:58:43,242 --> 01:58:44,284
Now, you die.

1007
01:58:45,077 --> 01:58:46,453
Today is not my day.

1008
01:59:31,749 --> 01:59:33,083
Hey!

1009
01:59:40,299 --> 01:59:41,925
Logan-san.

1010
01:59:42,092 --> 01:59:44,136
Don't look so shocked.

1011
01:59:46,513 --> 01:59:50,350
With you at my side,
I survived Nagasaki.

1012
01:59:50,517 --> 01:59:53,145
Surely,
I could survive this.

1013
01:59:54,813 --> 01:59:57,649
It's all right.
It won't take long.

1014
01:59:58,192 --> 02:00:01,195
Dr. Green and I have been waiting.

1015
02:00:01,487 --> 02:00:05,032
It's only this armor
that's kept me alive.

1016
02:00:05,199 --> 02:00:10,120
We built it to make me strong, so I
can take what you would not give.

1017
02:00:10,287 --> 02:00:13,499
And transfer your
unwanted healing...

1018
02:00:14,374 --> 02:00:16,543
to my body.

1019
02:00:18,837 --> 02:00:22,132
My legacy must
be preserved.

1020
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,386
Your mistake was to believe
that a life without end...

1021
02:00:26,553 --> 02:00:27,846
can have no meaning.

1022
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:33,644
It is the only life that can.

1023
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:36,522
Hold on.

1024
02:00:36,688 --> 02:00:38,524
We are almost there.

1025
02:00:38,690 --> 02:00:42,694
The peace,
the peace you've wanted.

1026
02:00:43,153 --> 02:00:45,322
Your reward.

1027
02:00:45,989 --> 02:00:49,159
You know, I'm giving
you the very death...

1028
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:51,870
you longed for.

1029
02:01:04,675 --> 02:01:05,717
This feeling...

1030
02:01:06,885 --> 02:01:09,388
to be invincible...

1031
02:01:12,015 --> 02:01:13,725
like you.

1032
02:01:26,530 --> 02:01:28,740
You are a monster.

1033
02:01:29,157 --> 02:01:30,325
Mariko.

1034
02:01:31,076 --> 02:01:33,579
It's me.
Your grandfather.

1035
02:01:35,414 --> 02:01:36,999
I buried my grandfather.

1036
02:02:40,145 --> 02:02:42,814
You asked me to
come say goodbye.

1037
02:02:43,440 --> 02:02:45,150
Sayonara.

1038
02:03:07,506 --> 02:03:09,341
Are you all right?

1039
02:03:18,684 --> 02:03:19,685
Logan.

1040
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:31,697
Logan.

1041
02:03:34,700 --> 02:03:35,867
Logan.

1042
02:03:48,046 --> 02:03:49,464
You're here.

1043
02:03:51,717 --> 02:03:53,385
Of course.

1044
02:03:55,053 --> 02:03:57,014
Can you stay?

1045
02:03:59,182 --> 02:04:01,184
I can't.

1046
02:04:03,562 --> 02:04:05,230
Yes, you can.

1047
02:04:07,024 --> 02:04:09,234
This is what you wanted.

1048
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:12,738
Not anymore.

1049
02:04:17,659 --> 02:04:20,245
I'm all alone here.

1050
02:04:24,499 --> 02:04:26,585
You put me here.

1051
02:04:28,462 --> 02:04:30,922
You were hurting
people, Jean.

1052
02:04:32,174 --> 02:04:33,633
I had to.

1053
02:04:42,142 --> 02:04:44,311
I love you, Jean.

1054
02:04:49,858 --> 02:04:51,693
I always will.

1055
02:05:28,355 --> 02:05:31,233
You are my only family.

1056
02:05:32,818 --> 02:05:35,153
Be well, sister.

1057
02:05:48,583 --> 02:05:51,795
Am I wrong to think
you might visit me soon?

1058
02:06:03,348 --> 02:06:04,641
Stay.

1059
02:06:06,309 --> 02:06:07,811
I can't, princess.

1060
02:06:08,728 --> 02:06:10,147
I'm a soldier,

1061
02:06:10,230 --> 02:06:11,982
and I've been
hiding too long.

1062
02:06:25,704 --> 02:06:28,373
<i>In our business
profile tonight, Mariko Yashida.</i></i>

1063
02:06:28,540 --> 02:06:31,334
<i>A two-generation passing of the
torch in the Yashida family...</i>

1064
02:06:31,501 --> 02:06:34,254
<i>as Mariko Yashida takes the
helm from her grandfather,</i>

1065
02:06:34,337 --> 02:06:35,463
<i>who built this tech giant.</i>

1066
02:06:35,630 --> 02:06:37,716
<i>I know it will always be
the purpose</i>

1067
02:06:37,799 --> 02:06:39,885
<i>for a corporation
to make a profit...</i>

1068
02:06:40,051 --> 02:06:44,306
<i>but Yashida Industries believes
we can also work with our community.</i>

1069
02:06:50,645 --> 02:06:52,856
So, have you decided?

1070
02:06:55,567 --> 02:06:56,318
What?

1071
02:06:56,776 --> 02:06:59,029
Mariko says we can
go wherever we want.

1072
02:06:59,196 --> 02:07:00,906
Just say where.

1073
02:07:02,157 --> 02:07:03,491
What are you doing?

1074
02:07:05,619 --> 02:07:07,412
I'm your bodyguard.

1075
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:13,627
So, where do you
want to go?

1076
02:07:15,879 --> 02:07:16,922
Uh...

1077
02:07:17,464 --> 02:07:19,382
Let's just start with up.

1078
02:07:19,549 --> 02:07:21,218
And then?

1079
02:07:25,222 --> 02:07:26,932
We'll see.

1080
02:07:29,309 --> 02:07:30,602
Interesting.

1081
02:09:22,130 --> 02:09:24,299
<i>With cutting edge technology,</i>

1082
02:09:24,382 --> 02:09:26,343
<i>and the world's

1083
02:09:26,509 --> 02:09:28,094

02:09:28,261 --> 02:09:31,473

<i>Solving tomorrow's
problems, today.</i>

1087
02:09:37,395 --> 02:09:38,772
I'll take the pat-down.

1088
02:09:38,938 --> 02:09:39,939
Opt out.

1089
02:09:52,869 --> 02:09:54,037
You can go ahead, sir.

1090
02:09:54,120 --> 02:09:55,246
I'll wait.

1091
02:10:03,838 --> 02:10:05,340
What do you want?

1092
02:10:07,092 --> 02:10:09,594
There are dark forces,
Wolverine.

1093
02:10:11,262 --> 02:10:13,348
Human forces
building a weapon...

1094
02:10:13,515 --> 02:10:16,935
that could bring about
the end of our kind.

1095
02:10:19,771 --> 02:10:22,899
What do I want?
I want your help.

1096
02:10:23,358 --> 02:10:24,943
Why would I trust you?

1097
02:10:26,111 --> 02:10:27,445
You wouldn't.

1098
02:10:52,137 --> 02:10:53,430
Hello, Logan.

1099
02:10:57,767 --> 02:10:59,644
How is this possible?

1100
02:10:59,811 --> 02:11:02,564
As I told you
a long time ago...

1101
02:11:03,815 --> 02:11:06,401
you are not
the only one with gifts.

1
00:00:48,712 --> 00:00:50,724
On your left.

2
00:01:00,825 --> 00:01:02,192
On your left.

3
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:04,773
On my left. Got it.

4
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,468
Don't say it. Don't you say it.

5
00:01:11,469 --> 00:01:13,480
- On your left.
- Come on!

6
00:01:21,812 --> 00:01:23,982
Need a medic?

7
00:01:26,116 --> 00:01:27,884
I need a new set of lungs.

8
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:31,354
Dude, you just ran, like,
13 miles in 30 minutes.

9
00:01:31,355 --> 00:01:32,688
I guess I got a late start.

10
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:35,324
Really? You should be
ashamed of yourself.

11
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:37,927
You should take another lap.

12
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:40,530
Did you just take it?
I assume you just took it.

13
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:41,931
What unit you with?

14
00:01:41,932 --> 00:01:43,566
58th Pararescue.

15
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:45,544
But now I'm working down at the VA.

16
00:01:45,669 --> 00:01:47,603
- Sam Wilson.
- Steve Rogers.

17
00:01:47,604 --> 00:01:50,343
I kind of put that together.

18
00:01:50,774 --> 00:01:53,911
Must have freaked you out, coming home
after the whole defrosting thing.

19
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:56,045
It takes some getting used to.

20
00:01:56,046 --> 00:01:57,814
It's good to meet you, Sam.

21
00:01:57,815 --> 00:01:59,359
It's your bed, right?

22
00:02:00,117 --> 00:02:01,250
What's that?

23
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,785
Your bed, it's too soft.

24
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:04,754
When I was over there,
I'd sleep on the ground,

25
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,855
use rock for pillows,
like a caveman.

26
00:02:06,856 --> 00:02:09,958
Now I'm home, lying in
my bed, and it's like...

27
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:11,359
Lying on a marshmallow.

28
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,496
Feel like I'm gonna sink
right to the floor.

29
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:15,831
How long?

30
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,467
Two tours.

31
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:20,045
You must miss the
good old days, huh?

32
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:23,071
Well, things aren't so bad.

33
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:25,674
Food's a lot better. We
used to boil everything.

34
00:02:25,675 --> 00:02:26,908
No polio is good.

35
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:28,443
Internet, so helpful.

36
00:02:28,444 --> 00:02:30,464
I've been reading that a
lot, trying to catch up.

37
00:02:31,914 --> 00:02:36,117
Marvin Gaye, 1972,
<i>Trouble Man</i> soundtrack.

38
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:38,687
Everything you missed
jammed into one album.

39
00:02:38,688 --> 00:02:41,325
I'll put it on the list.

40
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:51,333
All right, Sam, duty calls.
Thanks for the run.

41
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:52,734
If that's what you
want to call running.

42
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:53,802
That's how it is?

43
00:02:53,803 --> 00:02:55,380
- That's how it is.
- Okay.

44
00:02:56,671 --> 00:02:59,106
Any time you want to stop by
the VA, make me look awesome

45
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:02,710
in front of the girl at the
front desk, just let me know.

46
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,722
- I'll keep it in mind.
- Yeah.

47
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,950
Hey, fellas.

48
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:11,886
Either one of you know
where the Smithsonian is?

49
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,687
I'm here to pick up a fossil.

50
00:03:13,688 --> 00:03:15,232
That's hilarious.

51
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,262
- How you doing?
- Hey.

52
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,530
Can't run everywhere.

53
00:03:23,531 --> 00:03:25,075
No, you can't.

54
00:03:32,407 --> 00:03:34,608
Target is a mobile
satellite launch platform,

55
00:03:34,609 --> 00:03:35,910
the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

56
00:03:35,911 --> 00:03:38,548
They were sending up their last
payload when pirates took them,

57
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:40,247
93 minutes ago.

58
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:42,149
- Any demands?
- Billion and a half.

59
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,286
- Why so steep?
- Because it's S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

60
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,154
So it's not off-course.
It's trespassing.

61
00:03:48,155 --> 00:03:49,756
I'm sure they have a good reason.

62
00:03:49,757 --> 00:03:51,824
You know, I'm getting a little
tired of being Fury's janitor.

63
00:03:51,825 --> 00:03:53,693
Relax. It's not that complicated.

64
00:03:53,694 --> 00:03:54,861
How many pirates?

65
00:03:54,862 --> 00:03:58,033
25. Top mercs led by this guy.

66
00:03:58,265 --> 00:04:01,868
Georges Batroc. Ex-DGSE,
Action Division.

67
00:04:01,869 --> 00:04:04,278
He's at the top of
Interpol's Red Notice.

68
00:04:04,605 --> 00:04:07,874
Before the French demobilized
him, he had 36 kill missions.

69
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:09,842
This guy's got a rep for
maximum casualties.

70
00:04:09,843 --> 00:04:11,044
Hostages?

71
00:04:11,045 --> 00:04:14,421
Mostly techs. One officer.
Jasper Sitwell.

72
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:15,982
They're in the galley.

73
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:17,750
What's Sitwell doing
on a launch ship?

74
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:19,852
All right, I'm gonna sweep
the deck and find Batroc.

75
00:04:19,853 --> 00:04:21,761
Nat, you kill the engines
and wait for instructions.

76
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:24,390
Rumlow, you sweep aft,
find the hostages,

77
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:26,225
get them to the life-pods,
get them out. Let's move.

78
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:27,930
S.T.R.I.K.E., you heard
the Cap. Gear up.

79
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:42,741
Secure channel seven.

80
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:43,809
Seven secure.

81
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,744
Did you do anything
fun Saturday night?

82
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:49,247
Well, all the guys from my
barbershop quartet are dead,

83
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,749
so, no, not really.

84
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,285
<i>Coming up on the drop zone, Cap.</i>

85
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:56,833
You know, if you ask Kristen out, from
Statistics, she'd probably say yes.

86
00:04:57,156 --> 00:04:58,666
That's why I don't ask.

87
00:05:00,026 --> 00:05:02,230
Too shy, or too scared?

88
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:04,405
Too busy!

89
00:05:05,198 --> 00:05:06,965
Was he wearing a parachute?

90
00:05:06,966 --> 00:05:08,544
No.

91
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:10,346
No, he wasn't.

92
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,652
Hey!

93
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,591
Don't move.

94
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:10,519
Thanks.

95
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,066
Yeah. You seemed pretty
helpless without me.

96
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:18,827
What about the nurse that lives
across the hall from you?

97
00:07:18,828 --> 00:07:19,962
She seems kind of nice.

98
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:21,763
Secure the engine room,
then find me a date.

99
00:07:21,764 --> 00:07:24,002
I'm multi-tasking.

100
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,268
I told Batroc...

101
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:27,669
If we want to make
S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

102
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:30,409
We have to start sending
them bodies now!

103
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:34,287
I have a bullet for someone...

104
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:36,345
You want a bullet in your head?

105
00:07:36,346 --> 00:07:38,366
Move that foot. You want
a bullet in the head...?

106
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:50,370
I don't like waiting.

107
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,498
Call Durand.

108
00:07:52,762 --> 00:07:55,864
I want this ship ready to
move when the ransom comes.

109
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,438
Start the engines.

110
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,040
Okay.

111
00:08:06,708 --> 00:08:08,252
Hey, sailor.

112
00:08:27,729 --> 00:08:29,273
Shut up.

113
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:32,739
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

114
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:41,481
All right, I've
waited long enough...

115
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,745
Hey!

116
00:08:45,746 --> 00:08:46,846
Find Batroc...

117
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,847
If I don't hear anything
in two minutes...

118
00:08:47,848 --> 00:08:49,282
I'll start killing them!

119
00:08:49,283 --> 00:08:50,861
I'll find him.

120
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,768
Two minutes.

121
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:34,498
Radio silence from
S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

122
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:39,975
Targets acquired.

123
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,678
S.T.R.I.K.E. in position.

124
00:09:42,302 --> 00:09:43,880
Natasha, what's your status?

125
00:09:45,939 --> 00:09:47,139
Status, Natasha.

126
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,684
Hang on!

127
00:10:04,224 --> 00:10:05,928
Engine room secure.

128
00:10:14,067 --> 00:10:15,611
Time is up.

129
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,547
Who wants to die first...?

130
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:20,706
You!

131
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,251
Get that one.

132
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,720
On my mark.

133
00:10:26,745 --> 00:10:28,179
<i>Three...</i>

134
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,088
<i>Two... One.</i>

135
00:10:35,754 --> 00:10:39,358
I told you, S.H.I.E.L.D.
doesn't negotiate.

136
00:10:42,594 --> 00:10:44,362
The line just went dead.

137
00:10:44,363 --> 00:10:46,374
I've lost contact with them...

138
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:02,016
Hostages en route to extraction.

139
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:05,316
<i>Romanoff missed the
rendezvous point, Cap.</i>

140
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:07,485
<i>Hostiles are still in play.</i>

141
00:11:07,486 --> 00:11:09,921
Natasha, Batroc's on the move.

142
00:11:09,922 --> 00:11:12,502
Circle back to Rumlow and
protect the hostages.

143
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:14,493
Natasha.

144
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,730
I thought you were more
than just a shield...

145
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,453
Let's see.

146
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,806
Well, this is awkward.

147
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:40,075
What are you doing?

148
00:12:40,076 --> 00:12:41,410
Backing up the hard drive.

149
00:12:41,411 --> 00:12:43,217
It's a good habit to get into.

150
00:12:43,313 --> 00:12:44,513
Rumlow needed your help.

151
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,422
What the hell are you doing here?

152
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:50,786
You're saving S.H.I.E.L.D. intel.

153
00:12:50,787 --> 00:12:52,121
Whatever I can get my hands on.

154
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,722
Our mission is to rescue hostages.

155
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:56,063
No, that's your mission,

156
00:12:57,293 --> 00:12:58,803
and you've done it beautifully.

157
00:12:59,562 --> 00:13:01,496
You just jeopardized
this whole operation.

158
00:13:01,497 --> 00:13:03,235
I think that's overstating things.

159
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,420
Okay.

160
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,296
That one's on me.

161
00:13:24,787 --> 00:13:26,730
You're damn right.

162
00:13:55,116 --> 00:13:57,251
You just can't stop yourself
from lying, can you?

163
00:13:57,252 --> 00:13:58,385
I didn't lie.

164
00:13:58,386 --> 00:13:59,853
Agent Romanoff had a different
mission than yours.

165
00:13:59,854 --> 00:14:01,788
Which you didn't feel
obliged to share.

166
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:03,690
I'm not obliged to do anything.

167
00:14:03,691 --> 00:14:05,225
Those hostages could
have died, Nick.

168
00:14:05,226 --> 00:14:08,996
I sent the greatest soldier in history
to make sure that didn't happen.

169
00:14:08,997 --> 00:14:11,331
Soldiers trust each other.
That's what makes it an army.

170
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:13,100
Not a bunch of guys running
around shooting guns.

171
00:14:13,101 --> 00:14:16,875
Last time I trusted
someone, I lost an eye.

172
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:20,774
Look, I didn't want you doing anything
you weren't comfortable with.

173
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:23,176
Agent Romanoff is comfortable
with everything.

174
00:14:23,177 --> 00:14:24,611
I can't lead a mission

175
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:26,547
when the people I'm leading
have missions of their own.

176
00:14:26,548 --> 00:14:29,349
It's called compartmentalization.

177
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,487
Nobody spills the secrets,
because nobody knows them all.

178
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:34,364
Except you.

179
00:14:37,691 --> 00:14:39,668
You're wrong about me.

180
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:41,765
I do share.

181
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:44,473
I'm nice like that.

182
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,367
- Insight bay.
<i>- Captain Rogers does not have</i>

183
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:49,835
<i>clearance for Project Insight.</i>

184
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:52,338
Director override.
Fury, Nicholas J.

185
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:54,350
<i>Confirmed.</i>

186
00:14:56,543 --> 00:14:58,850
You know, they used to play music.

187
00:14:58,912 --> 00:15:00,112
Yeah.

188
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:03,849
My grandfather operated one
of these things for 40 years.

189
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:06,452
Granddad worked in a nice building.

190
00:15:06,453 --> 00:15:08,220
Got good tips.

191
00:15:08,221 --> 00:15:12,625
He'd walk home every night, a roll
of ones stuffed in his lunch bag.

192
00:15:12,626 --> 00:15:14,060
He'd say, "Hi."

193
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:16,368
People would say, "Hi" back.

194
00:15:16,797 --> 00:15:19,231
Time went on, the
neighborhood got rougher.

195
00:15:19,232 --> 00:15:20,776
He'd say, "Hi."

196
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:22,902
They'd say, "Keep on steppin'."

197
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:25,539
Granddad got to gripping that
lunch bag a little tighter.

198
00:15:25,972 --> 00:15:27,516
Did he ever get mugged?

199
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:32,143
Every week some punk would
say, "What's in the bag?"

200
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:34,012
What would he do?

201
00:15:34,013 --> 00:15:35,717
He'd show them.

202
00:15:35,781 --> 00:15:39,760
Bunch of crumpled ones,
and a loaded .22 Magnum.

203
00:15:43,422 --> 00:15:45,558
Yeah, Granddad loved people.

204
00:15:45,992 --> 00:15:48,833
But he didn't trust them very much.

205
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,967
Yeah, I know.

206
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,946
They're a little bit
bigger than a .22.

207
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:35,339
This is Project Insight.

208
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,775
Three next-generation helicarriers

209
00:16:37,776 --> 00:16:40,611
synced to a network of
targeting satellites.

210
00:16:40,612 --> 00:16:42,579
Launched from the <i>Lemurian Star.</i>

211
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:45,816
Once we get them in the air,
they never need to come down.

212
00:16:45,817 --> 00:16:50,688
Continuous sub-orbital flight,
courtesy of our new repulsor engines.

213
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,189
Stark?

214
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,557
He had a few suggestions

215
00:16:53,558 --> 00:16:56,297
once he got an up-close
look at our old turbines.

216
00:16:56,795 --> 00:16:59,296
These new long-range precision guns

217
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:01,865
can eliminate 1,000
hostiles a minute.

218
00:17:01,866 --> 00:17:06,641
The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA
before he steps outside his spider hole.

219
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:09,672
We're gonna neutralize a lot of
threats before they even happen.

220
00:17:09,673 --> 00:17:11,774
Thought the punishment usually
came after the crime.

221
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,309
We can't afford to wait that long.

222
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,944
Who's "we"?

223
00:17:14,945 --> 00:17:17,447
After New York, I convinced
the World Security Council

224
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:20,289
we needed a quantum surge
in threat analysis.

225
00:17:20,617 --> 00:17:23,219
For once, we're way
ahead of the curve.

226
00:17:23,587 --> 00:17:27,031
By holding a gun to everyone on
Earth and calling it protection.

227
00:17:28,058 --> 00:17:30,638
You know, I read those SSR files.

228
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:32,462
"Greatest Generation"?

229
00:17:32,663 --> 00:17:34,664
You guys did some nasty stuff.

230
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:36,676
Yeah, we compromised.

231
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:38,901
Sometimes in ways that
made us not sleep so well.

232
00:17:38,902 --> 00:17:41,471
But we did it so that
people could be free.

233
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:43,740
This isn't freedom. This is fear.

234
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:47,410
S.H.I.E.L.D. takes the world as
it is, not as we'd like it to be.

235
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:51,925
And it's getting damn near past time
for you to get with that program, Cap.

236
00:17:52,382 --> 00:17:54,723
Don't hold your breath.

237
00:18:12,835 --> 00:18:14,970
<i>Welcome to the Smithsonian.</i>

238
00:18:14,971 --> 00:18:19,109
<i>Visitor information booths are
available on the second level.</i>

239
00:18:27,617 --> 00:18:30,322
<i>A symbol to the nation.</i>

240
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:33,264
<i>A hero to the world.</i>

241
00:18:34,023 --> 00:18:40,369
<i>The story of Captain America is one
of honor, bravery and sacrifice.</i>

242
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:47,568
<i>Denied enlistment
due to poor health,</i>

243
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,904
<i>Steven Rogers was
chosen for a program</i>

244
00:18:49,905 --> 00:18:53,611
<i>unique in the annals
of American warfare.</i>

245
00:18:54,075 --> 00:18:59,522
<i>One that would transform him into
the world's first Super-Soldier.</i>

246
00:19:05,654 --> 00:19:06,821
<i>In this rare footage,</i>

247
00:19:06,822 --> 00:19:09,456
<i>everyone's favorite war
hero, Captain America...</i>

248
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:11,058
<i>Battle tested,</i>

249
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:12,493
<i>Captain America</i>

250
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:15,663
<i>and his Howling Commandos
quickly earned their stripes.</i>

251
00:19:15,664 --> 00:19:17,131
<i>Their mission:</i>

252
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:21,236
<i>taking down HYDRA, the Nazi
rogue science division.</i>

253
00:19:24,105 --> 00:19:26,651
<i>Best friends since childhood,</i>

254
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:30,644
<i>Bucky Barnes and Steven
Rogers were inseparable</i>

255
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:33,020
<i>on both schoolyard and battlefield.</i>

256
00:19:33,782 --> 00:19:38,084
<i>Barnes is the only Howling
Commando to give his life</i>

257
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:41,222
<i>in service of his country.</i>

258
00:19:45,826 --> 00:19:47,594
<i>That was a difficult winter.</i>

259
00:19:47,595 --> 00:19:51,404
<i>A blizzard had trapped half our
battalion behind the German line.</i>

260
00:19:51,699 --> 00:19:54,968
<i>Steve, Captain Rogers,</i>

261
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:57,770
<i>he fought his way through
a HYDRA blockade</i>

262
00:19:57,771 --> 00:20:00,942
<i>that had pinned our
allies down for months.</i>

263
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:04,387
<i>He saved over 1,000 men.</i>

264
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:06,883
<i>Including the man who would...</i>

265
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,261
<i>Who would become my
husband, as it turned out.</i>

266
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,825
<i>Even after he died, Steve
was still changing my life.</i>

267
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:19,234
You should be proud
of yourself, Peggy.

268
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:29,803
I have lived a life.

269
00:20:31,204 --> 00:20:34,978
My only regret is that you
didn't get to live yours.

270
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:39,322
What is it?

271
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:45,352
For as long as I can remember,
I just wanted to do what was right.

272
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,260
I guess I'm not quite sure
what that is anymore.

273
00:20:51,624 --> 00:20:55,928
And I thought I could throw
myself back in and follow orders.

274
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,031
Serve.

275
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,302
It's just not the same.

276
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,348
You're always so dramatic.

277
00:21:07,907 --> 00:21:12,148
Look, you saved the world.

278
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,215
We rather mucked it up.

279
00:21:18,216 --> 00:21:20,051
You didn't.

280
00:21:20,052 --> 00:21:24,395
Knowing that you helped found
S.H.I.E.L.D. is half the reason I stay.

281
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:26,267
Hey.

282
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:33,403
The world has changed, and
none of us can go back.

283
00:21:33,899 --> 00:21:36,334
All we can do is our best.

284
00:21:36,335 --> 00:21:41,145
And sometimes the best that
we can do is to start over.

285
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,558
Peggy.

286
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,364
Steve.

287
00:21:56,655 --> 00:21:58,393
Yeah?

288
00:21:59,491 --> 00:22:01,331
You're alive.

289
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,662
You came back.

290
00:22:04,663 --> 00:22:06,366
Yeah, Peggy.

291
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:12,107
It's been so long.

292
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:16,116
So long.

293
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,342
Well, I couldn't
leave my best girl.

294
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:21,945
Not when she owes me a dance.

295
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:29,257
Secure office.

296
00:22:36,827 --> 00:22:40,237

Fury, Nicholas J.

301
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:56,812
<i>Override denied. All files sealed.</i>

302
00:22:56,813 --> 00:22:58,447
On whose authority?

303
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:01,187
<i>Fury, Nicholas J.</i>

304
00:23:06,222 --> 00:23:07,523
World Security Council.

305
00:23:07,524 --> 00:23:09,296
<i>Confirmed.</i>

306
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:13,695
<i>If Nick Fury thinks he can
get his costumed thugs</i>

307
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:17,199
<i>and S.T.R.I.K.E. commandos to mop
up his mess, he's sadly mistaken.</i>

308
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,667
This failure is unacceptable.

309
00:23:18,668 --> 00:23:20,402
Considering this attack took place

310
00:23:20,403 --> 00:23:22,337
one mile from my country's
sovereign waters,

311
00:23:22,338 --> 00:23:24,840
it's a bit more than that.
I move for immediate hearing.

312
00:23:24,841 --> 00:23:26,942
We don't need hearings,
we need action.

313
00:23:26,943 --> 00:23:29,411
It's this Council's duty
to oversee S.H.I.E.L.D.

314
00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:31,480
A breach like this raises
serious questions.

315
00:23:31,481 --> 00:23:33,415
Like how the hell
did a French pirate

316
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:37,486
manage to hijack a covert S.H.I.E.L.D.
vessel in broad daylight?

317
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:40,033
For the record, Councilman,
he's Algerian.

318
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:42,357
I can draw a map if it'd help.

319
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:45,699
I appreciate your wit,
Secretary Pierce.

320
00:23:45,961 --> 00:23:49,130
But this Council takes things like
international piracy fairly seriously.

321
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:52,905
Really? I don't.

322
00:23:53,702 --> 00:23:56,908
I don't care about one boat,
I care about the fleet.

323
00:23:57,506 --> 00:24:00,341
If this Council is going
to fall to rancor

324
00:24:00,342 --> 00:24:03,513
every time someone pushes
us on the playing field,

325
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:06,581
maybe we need someone
to oversee US.

326
00:24:06,582 --> 00:24:09,526
Mr. Secretary, nobody
is suggesting...

327
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:14,255
Excuse me.

328
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:15,957
More trouble, Mr. Secretary?

329
00:24:15,958 --> 00:24:18,196
Depends on your definition.

330
00:24:26,401 --> 00:24:29,737
I work 40 floors away and it takes
a hijacking for you to visit?

331
00:24:29,738 --> 00:24:32,375
A nuclear war would do it, too.

332
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:34,375
You busy in there?

333
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:36,318
Nothing some earmarks can't fix.

334
00:24:37,778 --> 00:24:41,689
I'm here to ask a favor.

335
00:24:41,949 --> 00:24:44,017
I want you to call for a vote.

336
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:46,620
Project Insight has to be delayed.

337
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:48,889
Nick, that's not a favor,

338
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,724
that's a sub-committee
hearing. Along one.

339
00:24:50,725 --> 00:24:52,526
It could be nothing.
It probably is nothing.

340
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:55,328
I just need time to
make sure it's nothing.

341
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:56,596
But if it's something?

342
00:24:56,597 --> 00:24:59,905
Then we'll both be damn glad those
helicarriers aren't in the air.

343
00:25:01,536 --> 00:25:03,046
Fine.

344
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:07,174
But you got to get Iron Man to
stop by my niece's birthday party.

345
00:25:07,175 --> 00:25:08,775
Thank you, sir.

346
00:25:08,776 --> 00:25:12,152
And not just a flyby.
He's got to mingle.

347
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:15,986
<i>The thing is,</i>

348
00:25:16,017 --> 00:25:18,528
I think it's getting worse.

349
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:21,655
A cop pulled me over last week.

350
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:23,496
He thought I was drunk.

351
00:25:24,158 --> 00:25:28,295
I swerved to miss a plastic bag.

352
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:31,333
I thought it was an IED.

353
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,401
Some stuff you leave there.

354
00:25:35,402 --> 00:25:37,703
Other stuff you bring back.

355
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:40,806
It's our job to figure
out how to carry it.

356
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:45,355
Is it gonna be in a big suitcase,
or in a little man-purse?

357
00:25:46,046 --> 00:25:47,624
It's up to you.

358
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,289
- I'll see you next week.
- Definitely.

359
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:54,523
Look who it is, the running man.

360
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:57,556
Caught the last few minutes.
It's pretty intense.

361
00:25:57,557 --> 00:26:01,070
Yeah, brother, we all
got the same problems.

362
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:02,761
Guilt,

363
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:04,534
regret.

364
00:26:04,698 --> 00:26:06,709
You lose someone?

365
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:09,744
My wingman, Riley.

366
00:26:10,203 --> 00:26:11,537
Flying a night mission.

367
00:26:11,538 --> 00:26:13,973
Standard PJ rescue op.

368
00:26:13,974 --> 00:26:16,241
Nothing we hadn't done
1,000 times before.

369
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:20,289
Until an RPG knocked Riley's
dumb ass out of the sky.

370
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:23,848
Nothing I could do.

371
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:26,395
It's like I was up
there just to watch.

372
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,153
- I'm sorry.
- After that,

373
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:33,201
I had a really hard time finding a
reason for being over there, you know?

374
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:37,501
But you're happy now,
back in the world?

375
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,733
The number of people giving me
orders is down to about zero.

376
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:43,278
So, hell yeah.

377
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:45,280
Are you thinking about getting out?

378
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:47,282
No.

379
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:50,511
I don't know.

380
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,588
To be honest, I don't know what I
would do with myself if I did.

381
00:26:54,747 --> 00:26:56,291
Ultimate fighting?

382
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:59,017
Just a great idea off
the top of my head.

383
00:26:59,018 --> 00:27:02,030
Seriously, you could do
whatever you want to do.

384
00:27:02,488 --> 00:27:04,032
What makes you happy?

385
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,592

I got to go, though.

433
00:33:44,715 --> 00:33:46,292
Okay. Bye.

434
00:33:46,949 --> 00:33:49,256
My aunt, she's kind
of an insomniac.

435
00:33:50,386 --> 00:33:51,930
Yeah.

436
00:33:52,955 --> 00:33:54,256
Hey, if you want...

437
00:33:54,257 --> 00:33:56,725
If you want, you're welcome
to use my machine.

438
00:33:56,726 --> 00:33:58,703
Might be cheaper than the
one in the basement.

439
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:01,073
Yeah? What's it cost?

440
00:34:01,531 --> 00:34:03,701
A cup of coffee?

441
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:08,203
Thank you, but

442
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:10,038
I already have a
load in downstairs,

443
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:13,075
and you really don't want
my scrubs in your machine.

444
00:34:13,076 --> 00:34:16,344
I just finished a rotation in the
infectious disease ward, so...

445
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,547
Well, I'll keep my distance.

446
00:34:18,548 --> 00:34:20,183
Hopefully, not too far.

447
00:34:22,652 --> 00:34:24,697
And I think you left
your stereo on.

448
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:27,489
Right. Thank you.

449
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:29,034
Yeah.

450
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:16,439
I don't remember giving you a key.

451
00:35:17,873 --> 00:35:20,475
You really think I'd need one?

452
00:35:21,977 --> 00:35:24,284
My wife kicked me out.

453
00:35:25,246 --> 00:35:27,052
I didn't know you were married.

454
00:35:28,082 --> 00:35:30,684
A lot of things you
don't know about me.

455
00:35:30,885 --> 00:35:33,328
I know, Nick. That's the problem.

456
00:35:47,601 --> 00:35:51,512
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but I had no place else to crash.

457
00:35:58,279 --> 00:36:00,290

458
00:36:02,416 --> 00:36:04,120

459
00:36:06,086 --> 00:36:08,121

His.

470
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:57,636

471
00:36:57,637 --> 00:36:58,871

<i>Do we have a 20 on the shooter?</i>

473
00:37:01,174 --> 00:37:03,014

00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,167
Is he gonna make it?

475
00:38:04,168 --> 00:38:06,270
I don't know.

476
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:08,838
Tell me about the shooter.

477
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:11,476
He's fast. Strong.

478
00:38:13,911 --> 00:38:15,751
Had a metal arm.

479
00:38:20,651 --> 00:38:22,252

480
00:38:22,486 --> 00:38:26,089
Three slugs, no rifling.

482
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:29,903
Yeah.

483
00:38:30,461 --> 00:38:31,761
He's in V-tach.

484
00:38:31,762 --> 00:38:33,630
- Crash cart coming in.
- Nurse, help me with the drape.

485
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:35,266
- BP's dropping.
- Defibrillator!

486
00:38:37,635 --> 00:38:39,369
I want you to charge him at 100.

487
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,870
Don't do this to me, Nick.

488
00:38:40,871 --> 00:38:42,472
Stand back.

489
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:43,840
Three, two,

490
00:38:43,841 --> 00:38:46,044
one. Clear.

491
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:48,677

- No pulse.

492
00:38:48,678 --> 00:38:49,745
Okay, 200, please.

493
00:38:49,746 --> 00:38:51,113
Stand back!

494
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:53,549
Three, two, one. Clear!

495
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,128
Get me epinephrine!

496
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:56,819

497
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,364
Negative.

498
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,133
Don't do this to me, Nick.
Don't do this to me.

499
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:23,912
What's the time?

500
00:39:23,913 --> 00:39:25,514
1:03, Doctor.

501
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:30,386
Time of death, 1:03 a.m.

502
00:40:07,423 --> 00:40:09,468
I need to take him.

503
00:40:22,971 --> 00:40:24,572

504
00:40:37,819 --> 00:40:39,397
Natasha!

505
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,323
Why was Fury in your apartment?

506
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:45,192
I don't know.

507
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,295
Cap, they want you

508
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:48,528
Yeah, give me a second.

509
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,073
They want you now.

510
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:52,641
Okay.

511
00:40:55,303 --> 00:40:57,940

514
00:41:07,782 --> 00:41:09,827

515
00:41:16,456 --> 00:41:18,228

- Yeah.

516
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:21,237

517
00:41:36,543 --> 00:41:37,710
Captain Rogers.

519
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,252

Sir, it's an honor.

522
00:41:46,553 --> 00:41:47,686
The honor's mine, Captain.

523
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:50,733
My father served in
the 101st. Come on in.

524
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:54,226
That photo was taken five
years after Nick and I met,

525
00:41:54,227 --> 00:41:56,762
when I was at State
Department in Bogota.

526
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:59,565
E.L.N. rebels took the embassy,

527
00:41:59,566 --> 00:42:04,203
and security got me out, but
the rebels took hostages.

528
00:42:04,204 --> 00:42:07,672
Nick was Deputy Chief of the
S.H.I.E.L.D. station there,

529
00:42:07,673 --> 00:42:09,073
and he comes to me with a plan.

530
00:42:09,074 --> 00:42:11,109
He wants to storm the
building through the sewers.

531
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:14,316
I said, "No, we'll negotiate."

532
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,750
Turned out, the E.L.N. didn't negotiate,
so they put out a kill order.

533
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:20,952
They stormed the basement,
and what do they find?

534
00:42:20,953 --> 00:42:22,998
They find it empty.

535
00:42:23,756 --> 00:42:25,790
Nick had ignored my direct order,

536
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:29,531
and carried out an unauthorized
military operation on foreign soil,

537
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:32,197
and saved the lives of a
dozen political officers,

538
00:42:32,198 --> 00:42:33,498
including my daughter.

539
00:42:33,499 --> 00:42:35,233
So you gave him a promotion.

540
00:42:35,234 --> 00:42:37,211
I've never had any
cause to regret it.

541
00:42:39,004 --> 00:42:41,584
Captain, why was Nick in
your apartment last night?

542
00:42:45,144 --> 00:42:46,745
I don't know.

543
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:49,284
Did you know it was bugged?

544
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:52,558
I did, because Nick told me.

545
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:55,494
Did he tell you he was
the one who bugged it?

546
00:43:01,659 --> 00:43:03,431
I want you to see something.

547
00:43:03,861 --> 00:43:05,495
<i>Who hired you, Batroc?</i>

548
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:06,763
Is that live?

549
00:43:06,764 --> 00:43:10,743
Yeah, they picked him up last night
in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.

550
00:43:11,336 --> 00:43:14,838
Are you saying he's a suspect?
Assassination isn't Batroc's line.

551
00:43:14,839 --> 00:43:17,741
No, no. It's more
complicated than that.

552
00:43:17,742 --> 00:43:20,477
Batroc was hired anonymously
to attack the Lemurian Star.

553
00:43:20,478 --> 00:43:24,423
And he was contacted by email
and paid by wire transfer,

554
00:43:24,749 --> 00:43:29,126
and then the money was run
through 17 fictitious accounts.

555
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:31,154
The last one going
to a holding company

556
00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:33,657
that was registered
to a Jacob Veech.

557
00:43:33,658 --> 00:43:35,058
Am I supposed to know who that is?

558
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:37,561
Not likely. Veech
died six years ago.

559
00:43:37,562 --> 00:43:40,768
His last address was
1435 Elmhurst Drive.

560
00:43:40,898 --> 00:43:44,809
When I first met Nick,
his mother lived at 1437.

561
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:49,639
Are you saying Fury
hired the pirates? Why?

562
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,981
The prevailing theory

563
00:43:52,509 --> 00:43:55,511
was that the hijacking was
a cover for the acquisition

564
00:43:55,512 --> 00:43:58,319
and sale of classified
intelligence.

565
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:03,023
The sale went sour and
that led to Nick's death.

566
00:44:05,722 --> 00:44:08,962
If you really knew Nick Fury,
you'd know that's not true.

567
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,362
Why do you think we're talking?

568
00:44:15,432 --> 00:44:18,100
See, I took a seat on the Council
not because I wanted to,

569
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:22,342
but because Nick asked me to,
because we were both realists.

570
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:28,284
We knew that, despite all the diplomacy
and the handshaking and the rhetoric,

571
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:31,318
to build a really better world

572
00:44:31,682 --> 00:44:35,228
sometimes means having to
tear the old one down.

573
00:44:36,952 --> 00:44:38,997
And that makes enemies.

574
00:44:40,656 --> 00:44:43,758
Those people that call you
dirty because you got the guts

575
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:47,203
to stick your hands in the mud and
try to build something better.

576
00:44:47,963 --> 00:44:51,305
And the idea that those
people could be happy today

577
00:44:52,101 --> 00:44:55,147
makes me really, really angry.

578
00:44:58,741 --> 00:45:00,875
Captain, you were the last
one to see Nick alive.

579
00:45:00,876 --> 00:45:03,422
I don't think that's an accident.

580
00:45:03,546 --> 00:45:05,591
And I don't think you do, either.

581
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:09,551
So, I'm gonna ask again.

582
00:45:09,552 --> 00:45:11,893
Why was he there?

583
00:45:14,323 --> 00:45:17,130
He told me not to trust anyone.

584
00:45:18,761 --> 00:45:21,534
I wonder if that included him.

585
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,301
I'm sorry.

586
00:45:27,302 --> 00:45:29,142
Those were his last words.

587
00:45:30,171 --> 00:45:31,943
Excuse me.

588
00:45:34,776 --> 00:45:36,543
Captain,

589
00:45:36,544 --> 00:45:40,091
somebody murdered my friend
and I'm gonna find out why.

590
00:45:40,582 --> 00:45:43,423
Anyone gets in my way,
they're gonna regret it.

591
00:45:44,352 --> 00:45:46,329
Anyone.

592
00:45:48,757 --> 00:45:50,597
Understood.

593
00:46:07,675 --> 00:46:09,243
Operations Control.

594
00:46:09,244 --> 00:46:11,221
<i>Confirmed.</i>

595
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:14,348
Keep all S.T.R.I.K.E.
personnel on site.

596
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:15,782
- Understood.
- Yes, sir.

597
00:46:15,783 --> 00:46:17,250
- Forensics.
<i>- Confirmed.</i>

598
00:46:17,251 --> 00:46:18,718
Cap.

599
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:20,263
Rumlow.

600
00:46:29,463 --> 00:46:32,398
Evidence Response found some fibers
on the roof they want us to see.

601
00:46:32,399 --> 00:46:34,100
You want me to get
the tac team ready?

602
00:46:34,101 --> 00:46:35,802
No, let's wait and see
what it is first.

603
00:46:35,803 --> 00:46:37,404
Right.

604
00:46:48,749 --> 00:46:51,056
What's the status so far?

605
00:46:51,752 --> 00:46:53,854
- Administrations level.
- Confirmed.

606
00:46:53,855 --> 00:46:55,831
Excuse me.

607
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:05,997
I'm sorry about what
happened with Fury.

608
00:47:05,998 --> 00:47:08,200
It's messed up, what
happened to him.

609
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:10,144
Thank you.

610
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:29,621
Records.

611
00:47:29,622 --> 00:47:31,257
<i>Confirmed.</i>

612
00:47:46,706 --> 00:47:49,115
Before we get started,

613
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,788
does anyone want to get out?

614
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,648
Mobilize S.T.R.I.K.E.
units, 25th floor.

615
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:44,268
Whoa, big guy.

616
00:48:44,863 --> 00:48:48,204
I just want you to know,
Cap, this isn't personal!

617
00:48:59,376 --> 00:49:01,080
It kind of feels personal.

618
00:49:09,553 --> 00:49:12,099
Drop the shield and put
your hands in the air!

619
00:49:28,238 --> 00:49:31,074
Give it up, Rogers!
Get that door open!

620
00:49:31,075 --> 00:49:33,120
You have nowhere to go!

621
00:49:52,395 --> 00:49:53,595
Are you kidding me?

622
00:49:53,596 --> 00:49:56,301
He's headed for the garage.
Lock down the bridge.

623
00:50:07,143 --> 00:50:10,612
<i>Stand down, Captain
Rogers. Stand down.</i>

624
00:50:10,613 --> 00:50:13,352
<i>Repeat, stand down.</i>

625
00:50:49,451 --> 00:50:51,385
Eyes here.

626
00:50:51,386 --> 00:50:53,454
Whatever your op is, bury it.

627
00:50:53,455 --> 00:50:54,955
This is Level One.

628
00:50:54,956 --> 00:50:56,824
Contact DOT.

629
00:50:56,825 --> 00:50:58,859
All traffic lights in
the district go red.

630
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,495
Shut all runways at BWI,

631
00:51:01,496 --> 00:51:03,330
IAD and Reagan.

632
00:51:03,331 --> 00:51:06,377
All security cameras in the city go
through this monitor right here.

633
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,736
Scan all open sources,

634
00:51:08,737 --> 00:51:10,538
phones, computers,

635
00:51:10,539 --> 00:51:12,174
PDAs. Whatever.

636
00:51:12,708 --> 00:51:13,941
If someone tweets about this guy,

637
00:51:13,942 --> 00:51:15,519
I want to know about it.

638
00:51:15,609 --> 00:51:17,577
With all due respect, if
S.H.I.E.L.D. is conducting

639
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:20,747
a manhunt for Captain America
we deserve to know why.

640
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:22,691
Because he lied to us.

641
00:51:23,684 --> 00:51:27,787
Captain Rogers has information
regarding the death of Director Fury.

642
00:51:27,788 --> 00:51:29,958
He refused to share it.

643
00:51:30,524 --> 00:51:33,161
As difficult as this is to accept,

644
00:51:33,794 --> 00:51:37,432
Captain America is a
fugitive from S.H.I.E.L.D.

645
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,657
- Where is it?
- Safe.

646
00:52:05,658 --> 00:52:07,659
- Do better.
- Where did you get it?

647
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:09,027
Why would I tell you?

648
00:52:09,028 --> 00:52:11,296
Fury gave it to you. Why?

649
00:52:11,297 --> 00:52:12,831
- What's on it?
- I don't know.

650
00:52:12,832 --> 00:52:14,066
Stop lying.

651
00:52:14,067 --> 00:52:16,112
I only act like I know
everything, Rogers.

652
00:52:16,936 --> 00:52:19,072
I bet you knew Fury hired
the pirates, didn't you?

653
00:52:19,939 --> 00:52:23,108
Well, it makes sense. The ship was
dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.

654
00:52:23,109 --> 00:52:24,915
I'm not gonna ask you again.

655
00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:27,984
I know who killed Fury.

656
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:34,052
Most of the intelligence community
doesn't believe he exists.

657
00:52:34,053 --> 00:52:37,089
The ones that do call
him the Winter Soldier.

658
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:39,324
He's credited with over
two dozen assassinations

659
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:41,727
in the last 50 years.

660
00:52:41,728 --> 00:52:43,662
So he's a ghost story.

661
00:52:43,663 --> 00:52:46,732
Five years ago, I was escorting
a nuclear engineer out of Iran.

662
00:52:46,733 --> 00:52:49,334
Somebody shot out my
tires near Odessa.

663
00:52:49,335 --> 00:52:51,703
We lost control, went
straight over a cliff.

664
00:52:51,704 --> 00:52:53,305
I pulled us out.

665
00:52:53,306 --> 00:52:55,680
But the Winter Soldier was there.

666
00:52:55,874 --> 00:52:58,576
I was covering my
engineer so he shot him

667
00:52:58,577 --> 00:53:00,155
straight through me.

668
00:53:00,445 --> 00:53:02,023
Soviet slug.

669
00:53:02,114 --> 00:53:05,285
No rifling. Bye-bye, bikinis.

670
00:53:06,185 --> 00:53:08,560
Yeah, I bet you look
terrible in them now.

671
00:53:10,722 --> 00:53:13,859
Going after him is a dead end.
I know, I've tried.

672
00:53:14,793 --> 00:53:17,373
Like you said, he's a ghost story.

673
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,768
Well, let's find out
what the ghost wants.

674
00:53:23,769 --> 00:53:26,280
<i>Nick Fury was murdered
in cold blood.</i>

675
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:27,738
To any reasonable person,

676
00:53:27,739 --> 00:53:30,575
that would make him a
martyr, not a traitor.

677
00:53:30,576 --> 00:53:32,043
You know what makes him a traitor?

678
00:53:32,044 --> 00:53:34,712
Hiring a mercenary to
hijack his own ship.

679
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,114
Nick Fury used your friendship

680
00:53:37,115 --> 00:53:40,384
to coerce this Council into
delaying Project Insight.

681
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:42,954
A project he knew would expose
his own illegal operations.

682
00:53:42,955 --> 00:53:46,022
At best, he lied to you.
At worst...

683
00:53:46,023 --> 00:53:48,625
Are you calling for my resignation?

684
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,126
I've got a pen and
paper right here.

685
00:53:50,127 --> 00:53:53,298
That discussion can be
tabled for a later time.

686
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,699
But you do want to
have a discussion?

687
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,109
We've already had
it, Mr. Secretary.

688
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:03,479
This Council moves to immediately
reactivate Project Insight.

689
00:54:04,308 --> 00:54:08,253
If you want to say something
snappy, now would be a good time.

690
00:54:13,651 --> 00:54:17,562
First rule of going on the
run is don't run, walk.

691
00:54:17,722 --> 00:54:20,666
If I run in these shoes,
they're gonna fall off.

692
00:54:23,194 --> 00:54:25,695
The drive has a Level Six homing
program, so as soon as we boot up

693
00:54:25,696 --> 00:54:27,664
S.H.I.E.L.D. will know
exactly where we are.

694
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:29,266
How much time will we have?

695
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:32,074
About nine minutes from

696
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,671
now.

697
00:54:39,509 --> 00:54:41,343
Fury was right about that ship.

698
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,712
Somebody's trying
to hide something.

699
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:45,681
This drive is protected
by some sort of AI.

700
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:48,417
It keeps rewriting itself
to counter my commands.

701
00:54:48,418 --> 00:54:50,429
Can you override it?

702
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:53,359
The person who developed this
is slightly smarter than me.

703
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:55,127
Slightly.

704
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:07,140
I'm gonna try running a tracer.

705
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,505
This is a program that
S.H.I.E.L.D. developed

706
00:55:09,506 --> 00:55:10,973
to track hostile malware,

707
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,976
so if we can't read the file,

708
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:16,181
maybe we can find out
where it came from.

709
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,722
Can I help you guys with anything?

710
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:21,684
No. My fiancé was just helping me
with some honeymoon destinations.

711
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,852
Right. We're getting married.

712
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,227
Congratulations. Where are you
guys thinking about going?

713
00:55:27,623 --> 00:55:29,725
New Jersey.

714
00:55:34,129 --> 00:55:36,231
I have the exact same glasses.

715
00:55:36,765 --> 00:55:38,700
Wow, you two are practically twins.

716
00:55:38,701 --> 00:55:40,541
Yeah, I wish.

717
00:55:40,569 --> 00:55:42,147
Specimen.

718
00:55:42,271 --> 00:55:44,405
If you guys need anything,
I've been Aaron.

719
00:55:44,406 --> 00:55:45,950
Thank you.

720
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,720
- You said nine minutes. Come on.
- Relax.

721
00:55:51,547 --> 00:55:53,125
Got it.

722
00:55:56,652 --> 00:55:57,852
You know it?

723
00:55:57,853 --> 00:56:00,023
I used to. Let's go.

724
00:56:01,690 --> 00:56:02,991
Standard tac team.

725
00:56:02,992 --> 00:56:04,659
Two behind, two across,

726
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:06,361
and two coming straight at us.

727
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:09,263
If they make us, I'll engage, you hit
the south escalator to the metro.

728
00:56:09,264 --> 00:56:11,399
Shut up and put your arm around me.
Laugh at something I said.

729
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,206
- What?
- Do it.

730
00:56:20,842 --> 00:56:22,042
Negative at the source.

731
00:56:22,043 --> 00:56:23,587
Give me a floor rundown.

732
00:56:23,644 --> 00:56:25,178
<i>Negative on three.</i>

733
00:56:25,179 --> 00:56:26,580
<i>Negative on two.</i>

734
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:29,183
Snake the upper levels.
Work down to me.

735
00:56:36,724 --> 00:56:37,924
- Kiss me.
- What?

736
00:56:37,925 --> 00:56:40,160
Public displays of affection make
people very uncomfortable.

737
00:56:40,161 --> 00:56:41,865
Yes, they do.

738
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:52,909
You still uncomfortable?

739
00:56:53,307 --> 00:56:55,250
It's not exactly the
word I would use.

740
00:57:03,851 --> 00:57:06,555
Where did Captain America
learn how to steal a car?

741
00:57:06,987 --> 00:57:08,921
Nazi Germany.

742
00:57:08,922 --> 00:57:11,502
And we're borrowing.
Take your feet off the dash.

743
00:57:15,262 --> 00:57:18,964
All right, I have a question for you,
which you do not have to answer.

744
00:57:18,965 --> 00:57:20,499
I feel like, if you
don't answer it though,

745
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,967
- you're kind of answering it, you know.
- What?

746
00:57:21,968 --> 00:57:24,970
Was that your first
kiss since 1945?

747
00:57:24,971 --> 00:57:26,772
- That bad, huh?
- I didn't say that.

748
00:57:26,773 --> 00:57:28,407
Well, it kind of sounds like
that's what you're saying.

749
00:57:28,408 --> 00:57:29,608
No, I didn't.

750
00:57:29,609 --> 00:57:31,744
I just wondered how much
practice you've had.

751
00:57:31,745 --> 00:57:33,546
- You don't need practice.
- Everybody needs practice.

752
00:57:33,547 --> 00:57:36,082
It was not my first
kiss since 1945.

753
00:57:36,083 --> 00:57:38,253
I'm 95, I'm not dead.

754
00:57:38,452 --> 00:57:40,429
Nobody special, though?

755
00:57:42,122 --> 00:57:43,389
Believe it or not,
it's kind of hard

756
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:45,624
to find someone with
shared life experience.

757
00:57:45,625 --> 00:57:47,660
Well, that's all right.
You just make something up.

758
00:57:47,661 --> 00:57:49,829
- What, like you?
- I don't know.

759
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:51,163
The truth is a matter
of circumstance.

760
00:57:51,164 --> 00:57:54,108
It's not all things to all
people, all the time.

761
00:57:54,734 --> 00:57:56,311
Neither am I.

762
00:57:56,669 --> 00:57:58,304
That's a tough way to live.

763
00:57:59,004 --> 00:58:01,606
It's a good way not to die, though.

764
00:58:02,007 --> 00:58:03,775
You know, it's kind of
hard to trust someone,

765
00:58:03,776 --> 00:58:05,717
when you don't know who
that someone really is.

766
00:58:06,245 --> 00:58:07,823
Yeah.

767
00:58:10,616 --> 00:58:12,217
Who do you want me to be?

768
00:58:12,651 --> 00:58:14,195
How about a friend?

769
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:21,628
Well, there's a chance you might
be in the wrong business, Rogers.

770
00:58:36,842 --> 00:58:38,819
This is it.

771
00:58:39,578 --> 00:58:42,021
The file came from
these coordinates.

772
00:58:42,448 --> 00:58:44,254
So did I.

773
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:54,192
This camp is where I was trained.

774
00:58:56,694 --> 00:58:58,329
Change much?

775
00:59:00,465 --> 00:59:01,732
A little.

776
00:59:01,733 --> 00:59:04,134
Pick up the pace, ladies!

777
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:06,180
Let's go! Let's go!

778
00:59:06,604 --> 00:59:08,239
Double time!

779
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,686
Come on, Rogers, move it!

780
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,088
Come on, fall in!

781
00:59:17,582 --> 00:59:19,016
Rogers!

782
00:59:19,017 --> 00:59:20,789
I said fall in!

783
00:59:22,687 --> 00:59:23,887
This is a dead end.

784
00:59:23,888 --> 00:59:27,332
Zero heat signatures,
zero waves, not even radio.

785
00:59:28,126 --> 00:59:31,468
Whoever wrote the file must have
used a router to throw people off.

786
00:59:32,864 --> 00:59:34,131
What is it?

787
00:59:34,132 --> 00:59:36,132
Army regulations forbid
storing munitions

788
00:59:36,133 --> 00:59:38,542
within 500 yards of the barracks.

789
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:41,349
This building is in
the wrong place.

790
00:59:56,286 --> 00:59:58,627
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.

791
00:59:58,956 --> 01:00:01,365
Maybe where it started.

792
01:00:18,976 --> 01:00:21,317
And there's Stark's father.

793
01:00:21,378 --> 01:00:23,321
Howard.

794
01:00:23,981 --> 01:00:25,786
Who's the girl?

795
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:47,439
If you're already working
in a secret office,

796
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,625
why do you need to
hide the elevator?

797
01:01:50,932 --> 01:01:55,344
This can't be the data point.
This technology is ancient.

798
01:02:24,598 --> 01:02:27,337
Y-E-S spells yes.

799
01:02:30,704 --> 01:02:33,306
Shall we play a game?

800
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:36,318
- It's from a movie that was really...
- I know, I saw it.

801
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:44,360
<i>Rogers, Steven,</i>

802
01:02:44,885 --> 01:02:47,226
<i>born 1918.</i>

803
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:52,592
<i>Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna,</i>

804
01:02:52,593 --> 01:02:54,660
<i>born 1984.</i>

805
01:02:54,661 --> 01:02:56,294
It's some kind of recording.

806
01:02:56,295 --> 01:02:59,273
<i>I am not a recording, Fraulein.</i>

807
01:02:59,298 --> 01:03:01,333
<i>I may not be the man I was</i>

808
01:03:01,334 --> 01:03:04,936
<i>when the Captain took
me prisoner in 1945.</i>

809
01:03:04,937 --> 01:03:07,175
<i>But I am.</i>

810
01:03:08,608 --> 01:03:10,312
You know this thing?

811
01:03:13,246 --> 01:03:16,715
Arnim Zola was a German scientist
who worked for the Red Skull.

812
01:03:16,716 --> 01:03:17,816
He's been dead for years.

813
01:03:17,817 --> 01:03:20,685
<i>First correction, I am Swiss.</i>

814
01:03:20,686 --> 01:03:23,155
<i>Second, look around you.</i>

815
01:03:23,156 --> 01:03:26,168
<i>I have never been more alive.</i>

816
01:03:26,325 --> 01:03:30,762
<i>In 1972, I received a
terminal diagnosis.</i>

817
01:03:30,763 --> 01:03:33,799
<i>Science could not save my body.</i>

818
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:38,203
<i>My mind, however,
that was worth saving,</i>

819
01:03:38,204 --> 01:03:42,140
<i>on 200,000 feet of databanks.</i>

820
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:45,876
<i>You are standing in my brain.</i>

821
01:03:45,877 --> 01:03:48,650
- How did you get here?
<i>- Invited.</i>

822
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,215
It was Operation Paperclip
after World War II.

823
01:03:51,216 --> 01:03:55,019
S.H.I.E.L.D. recruited German
scientists with strategic value.

824
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:57,421
<i>They thought I could
help their cause.</i>

825
01:03:57,422 --> 01:03:59,490
<i>I also helped my own.</i>

826
01:03:59,491 --> 01:04:01,125
HYDRA died With the Red Skull.

827
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:05,496
<i>Cut off one head, two more
shall take its place.</i>

828
01:04:05,497 --> 01:04:07,337
Prove it.

829
01:04:08,233 --> 01:04:10,642
<i>Accessing archive.</i>

830
01:04:10,769 --> 01:04:14,205
<i>HYDRA was founded on the
belief that humanity</i>

831
01:04:14,206 --> 01:04:17,641
<i>could not be trusted
with its own freedom.</i>

832
01:04:17,642 --> 01:04:20,478
<i>What we did not realize
was that if you try</i>

833
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:23,787
<i>to take that freedom, they resist.</i>

834
01:04:24,082 --> 01:04:26,252
<i>The war taught us much.</i>

835
01:04:26,284 --> 01:04:30,127
<i>Humanity needed to surrender
its freedom willingly.</i>

836
01:04:30,622 --> 01:04:33,724
<i>After the war, S.H.I.E.L.D.
was founded,</i>

837
01:04:33,725 --> 01:04:36,159
<i>and I was recruited.</i>

838
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,394
<i>The new HYDRA grew.</i>

839
01:04:38,395 --> 01:04:43,032
<i>A beautiful parasite
inside S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

840
01:04:43,033 --> 01:04:44,834
<i>For 70 years,</i>

841
01:04:44,835 --> 01:04:50,607
<i>HYDRA has been secretly
feeding crisis, reaping war,</i>

842
01:04:50,608 --> 01:04:53,950
<i>and when history did not cooperate,</i>

843
01:04:54,245 --> 01:04:56,212
<i>history was changed.</i>

844
01:04:56,213 --> 01:04:58,548
That's impossible. S.H.I.E.L.D.
would have stopped you.

845
01:04:58,549 --> 01:05:01,356
<i>Accidents will happen.</i>

846
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:05,922
<i>HYDRA created a world so chaotic</i>

847
01:05:05,923 --> 01:05:10,126
<i>that humanity is finally ready
to sacrifice its freedom</i>

848
01:05:10,127 --> 01:05:12,673
<i>to gain its security.</i>

849
01:05:12,897 --> 01:05:16,599
<i>Once a purification
process is complete,</i>

850
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:20,613
<i>HYDRA's new world order will arise.</i>

851
01:05:20,971 --> 01:05:23,072
<i>We won, Captain.</i>

852
01:05:23,073 --> 01:05:27,075
<i>Your death amounts to
the same as your life.</i>

853
01:05:27,076 --> 01:05:28,654
<i>A zero sum.</i>

854
01:05:31,681 --> 01:05:34,261
<i>As I was saying...</i>

855
01:05:34,551 --> 01:05:35,684
What's on this drive?

856
01:05:35,685 --> 01:05:39,494
<i>Project Insight requires insight.</i>

857
01:05:39,556 --> 01:05:42,457
<i>So, I wrote an algorithm.</i>

858
01:05:42,458 --> 01:05:43,692
What kind of algorithm?
What does it do?

859
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:46,628
<i>The answer to your
question is fascinating.</i>

860
01:05:46,629 --> 01:05:51,234
<i>Unfortunately, you shall
be too dead to hear it.</i>

861
01:05:56,739 --> 01:05:58,545
Steve, we got a bogey.

862
01:05:58,575 --> 01:06:00,409
Short range ballistic.

863
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:02,110
- 30 seconds tops.
- Who fired it?

864
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,278
S.H.I.E.L.D.

865
01:06:03,279 --> 01:06:07,520
<i>I am afraid I have been
stalling, Captain.</i>

866
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:08,750
<i>Admit it.</i>

867
01:06:08,751 --> 01:06:11,286
<i>It's better this way.</i>

868
01:06:11,287 --> 01:06:13,264
<i>We are, both of us,</i>

869
01:06:13,923 --> 01:06:15,762
<i>out of time.</i>

870
01:07:38,706 --> 01:07:40,683
Call in the asset.

871
01:07:56,456 --> 01:07:58,262
I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce.

872
01:07:58,358 --> 01:08:00,665
You need anything before I leave?

873
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:04,738
No... It's fine, Renata,
you can go home.

874
01:08:04,764 --> 01:08:06,632
Okay. Night-night.

875
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:08,974
Good night.

876
01:08:13,606 --> 01:08:15,412
Want some milk?

877
01:08:24,651 --> 01:08:26,992
The timetable has moved.

878
01:08:28,655 --> 01:08:30,859
Our window is limited.

879
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,997
Two targets, Level Six.

880
01:08:37,831 --> 01:08:40,365
They already cost me Zola.

881
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:43,139
I want confirmed death in 10 hours.

882
01:08:44,571 --> 01:08:47,071
Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...

883
01:08:47,072 --> 01:08:48,673
I forgot my

884
01:08:48,674 --> 01:08:50,184
phone.

885
01:08:54,713 --> 01:08:58,351
Renata, I wish you
would have knocked.

886
01:09:22,508 --> 01:09:23,708
Hey, man.

887
01:09:23,709 --> 01:09:27,445
I'm sorry about this. We
need a place to lay low.

888
01:09:27,446 --> 01:09:29,457
Everyone we know is
trying to kill us.

889
01:09:31,917 --> 01:09:34,053
Not everyone.

890
01:09:50,468 --> 01:09:52,604
- You okay?
- Yeah.

891
01:10:01,045 --> 01:10:03,147
What's going on?

892
01:10:05,716 --> 01:10:09,763
When I first joined S.H.I.E.L.D.
I thought I was going straight.

893
01:10:12,990 --> 01:10:16,434
But I guess I just traded
in the KGB for HYDRA.

894
01:10:21,766 --> 01:10:24,403
I thought I knew whose
lies I was telling,

895
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:31,048
but I guess I can't tell
the difference anymore.

896
01:10:31,541 --> 01:10:33,984
There's a chance you might
be in the wrong business.

897
01:10:38,682 --> 01:10:40,260
I owe you.

898
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:42,918
It's okay.

899
01:10:42,919 --> 01:10:45,692
If it was the other way around,

900
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:48,023
and it was down to me
to save your life,

901
01:10:48,024 --> 01:10:50,194
now you be honest with me,

902
01:10:51,661 --> 01:10:54,241
would you trust me to do it?

903
01:10:55,732 --> 01:10:57,276
I would now.

904
01:10:59,769 --> 01:11:02,178
And I'm always honest.

905
01:11:02,839 --> 01:11:04,240
Well, you seem pretty chipper

906
01:11:04,241 --> 01:11:06,421
for someone who just found
out they died for nothing.

907
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:11,119
Well, guess I just like
to know who I'm fighting.

908
01:11:11,448 --> 01:11:12,992
I made breakfast.

909
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:16,492
If you guys eat that sort of thing.

910
01:11:17,653 --> 01:11:19,120
So, the question is,

911
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:21,632
who at S.H.I.E.L.D. could launch
a domestic missile strike?

912
01:11:23,192 --> 01:11:24,559
Pierce.

913
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,328
Who happens to be sitting on top of the
most secure building in the world.

914
01:11:27,329 --> 01:11:28,763
But he's not working alone.

915
01:11:28,764 --> 01:11:31,401
Zola's algorithm was
on the Lemurian Star.

916
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:34,203
So was Jasper Sitwell.

917
01:11:37,306 --> 01:11:39,674
So, the real question is, how
do the two most wanted people

918
01:11:39,675 --> 01:11:43,188
in Washington kidnap a S.H.I.E.L.D.
officer in broad daylight?

919
01:11:43,646 --> 01:11:46,021
The answer is, you don't.

920
01:11:46,448 --> 01:11:48,652
- What's this?
- Call it a résumé.

921
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,621
Is this Bakhmala?

922
01:11:53,622 --> 01:11:55,428
The Khalid Khandil
mission, that was you?

923
01:11:56,625 --> 01:11:58,602
You didn't say he was a Pararescue.

924
01:11:59,828 --> 01:12:02,196
- Is this Riley?
- Yeah.

925
01:12:02,197 --> 01:12:04,832
I heard they couldn't bring in the
choppers because of the RPGs.

926
01:12:04,833 --> 01:12:05,866
What did you use? A stealth chute?

927
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:07,445
No.

928
01:12:07,635 --> 01:12:09,680
These.

929
01:12:14,075 --> 01:12:15,742
I thought you said
you were a pilot.

930
01:12:15,743 --> 01:12:17,481
I never said pilot.

931
01:12:20,982 --> 01:12:23,186
I can't ask you to do this, Sam.

932
01:12:23,451 --> 01:12:24,952
You got out for a good reason.

933
01:12:24,953 --> 01:12:26,620
Dude, Captain America
needs my help.

934
01:12:26,621 --> 01:12:28,791
There's no better
reason to get back in.

935
01:12:31,993 --> 01:12:33,827
Where can we get our hands
on one of these things?

936
01:12:33,828 --> 01:12:35,532
The last one is at Fort Meade.

937
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:39,167
Behind three guarded gates
and a 12-inch steel wall.

938
01:12:41,669 --> 01:12:43,179
Shouldn't be a problem.

939
01:12:44,272 --> 01:12:46,239
Listen, I got to fly home tonight

940
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,242
because I got some
constituency problem

941
01:12:49,243 --> 01:12:51,345
and I got to press the flesh.

942
01:12:51,346 --> 01:12:54,147
Any constituent in
particular, Mr. Senator?

943
01:12:54,148 --> 01:12:56,192
No, not really.

944
01:12:56,583 --> 01:12:59,026
Twenty-three, kind of hot.

945
01:12:59,086 --> 01:13:00,486
Real hot, you know?

946
01:13:00,487 --> 01:13:02,688
Wants to be a reporter,
I think. I don't know.

947
01:13:02,689 --> 01:13:03,923
Who listens at that point?

948
01:13:03,924 --> 01:13:05,725
Doesn't sound like much
of a problem to me.

949
01:13:05,726 --> 01:13:08,328
Really? Because she's
killing my back.

950
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:10,730
But this isn't the place
to talk about it.

951
01:13:10,731 --> 01:13:12,309
This is a nice pin.

952
01:13:13,100 --> 01:13:15,702
- Thank you.
- Come here.

953
01:13:16,036 --> 01:13:17,979
Hail HYDRA.

954
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,981
- See, it's right there...
- Yeah, I just saw that.

955
01:13:23,343 --> 01:13:25,323
- Should I get it checked?
- I think you should.

956
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,920
I need a minute.

957
01:13:34,921 --> 01:13:37,262
Bring the car around.

958
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:41,560
Yes, sir?

959
01:13:41,561 --> 01:13:43,396
<i>Agent Sitwell, how was lunch?</i>

960
01:13:43,397 --> 01:13:46,064
<i>I hear the crab cakes
here are delicious.</i>

961
01:13:46,065 --> 01:13:47,298
Who is this?

962
01:13:47,299 --> 01:13:50,436
<i>The good-looking guy in the
sunglasses, your 10 o'clock.</i>

963
01:13:52,071 --> 01:13:53,706
<i>Your other 10 o'clock.</i>

964
01:13:55,074 --> 01:13:56,618
<i>There you go.</i>

965
01:13:58,878 --> 01:14:00,745
What do you want?

966
01:14:00,746 --> 01:14:02,747
<i>You're gonna go around the
corner to your right.</i>

967
01:14:02,748 --> 01:14:05,383
There's a gray car two spaces down.

968
01:14:05,384 --> 01:14:07,419
You and I are gonna take a ride.

969
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:09,320
And why would I do that?

970
01:14:09,321 --> 01:14:12,333
Because that tie looks
really expensive,

971
01:14:12,358 --> 01:14:14,869
<i>and I'd hate to mess it up.</i>

972
01:14:23,803 --> 01:14:25,609
Tell me about Zola's algorithm.

973
01:14:26,205 --> 01:14:27,338
Never heard of it.

974
01:14:27,339 --> 01:14:28,473
What were you doing
on the <i>Lemurian Star</i>?

975
01:14:28,474 --> 01:14:30,610
I was throwing up. I get seasick.

976
01:14:35,313 --> 01:14:39,122
Is this little display meant to insinuate
that you're gonna throw me off the roof?

977
01:14:39,751 --> 01:14:41,557
Because it's really not
your style, Rogers.

978
01:14:42,353 --> 01:14:43,897
You're right.

979
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:45,656
It's not.

980
01:14:45,657 --> 01:14:47,201
It's hers.

981
01:14:50,595 --> 01:14:53,697
Wait. What about that girl
from Accounting, Laura...

982
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,632
Lillian. Lip piercing, right?

983
01:14:55,633 --> 01:14:56,967
Yeah, she's cute.

984
01:14:56,968 --> 01:14:59,104
Yeah. I'm not ready for that.

985
01:15:10,448 --> 01:15:13,028
Zola's algorithm is a program

986
01:15:14,119 --> 01:15:15,486
for choosing

987
01:15:15,487 --> 01:15:17,387
- Insight's targets.
- What targets?

988
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:18,989
You!

989
01:15:19,457 --> 01:15:21,959
A TV anchor in Cairo, the
Under Secretary of Defense,

990
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,761
a high school Valedictorian
in Iowa City,

991
01:15:24,762 --> 01:15:26,996
Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange,
anyone who's a threat

992
01:15:26,997 --> 01:15:28,698
to HYDRA.

993
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:30,800
Now, or in the future.

994
01:15:30,801 --> 01:15:33,210
In the future? How could it know?

995
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,784
How could it not?

996
01:15:39,443 --> 01:15:43,354
The 21st century is a digital book.

997
01:15:44,047 --> 01:15:46,354
Zola taught HYDRA how to read it.

998
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,386
Your bank records,

999
01:15:50,387 --> 01:15:51,921
medical histories, voting patterns,

1000
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:54,934
emails, phone calls,
your damn SAT scores!

1001
01:15:55,859 --> 01:15:59,804
Zola's algorithm
evaluates people's past

1002
01:16:00,164 --> 01:16:01,597
to predict their future.

1003
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:03,199
And what then?

1004
01:16:06,136 --> 01:16:08,037
Oh, my God. Pierce
is gonna kill me.

1005
01:16:08,038 --> 01:16:10,208
What then?

1006
01:16:12,176 --> 01:16:15,779
Then the Insight helicarriers
scratch people off the list.

1007
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,921
A few million at a time.

1008
01:16:26,956 --> 01:16:28,256
HYDRA doesn't like leaks.

1009
01:16:28,257 --> 01:16:30,125
Then why don't you try
sticking a cork in it?

1010
01:16:30,126 --> 01:16:31,660
Insight's launching in 16 hours.

1011
01:16:31,661 --> 01:16:32,761
We're cutting it a
little bit close here.

1012
01:16:32,762 --> 01:16:34,863
I know. We'll use him
to bypass the DNA scans

1013
01:16:34,864 --> 01:16:36,598
and access the
helicarriers directly.

1014
01:16:36,599 --> 01:16:38,177
What? Are you crazy?

1015
01:16:38,501 --> 01:16:40,705
That is a terrible, terrible idea.

1016
01:17:23,878 --> 01:17:25,650
Shit!

1017
01:17:36,558 --> 01:17:38,364
Hang on!

1018
01:19:18,324 --> 01:19:21,768
I have her. Find him.

1019
01:20:26,557 --> 01:20:28,101
Go! I got this!

1020
01:21:07,631 --> 01:21:09,466
<i>Taking fire above and
below expressway.</i>

1021
01:21:09,467 --> 01:21:12,308
<i>Civilians threatened. Repeat,
civilians threatened.</i>

1022
01:21:15,972 --> 01:21:18,874
<i>I make an LZ, 2300 block
of Virginia Avenue.</i>

1023
01:21:18,875 --> 01:21:20,476
<i>Rendezvous, two minutes.</i>

1024
01:21:45,502 --> 01:21:46,935
Get out of the way!

1025
01:21:46,936 --> 01:21:49,174
Stay out of the way!

1026
01:23:35,743 --> 01:23:37,310
Bucky?

1027
01:23:37,311 --> 01:23:39,322
Who the hell is Bucky?

1028
01:24:07,407 --> 01:24:09,074
Drop the shield, Cap!
Get on your knees!

1029
01:24:09,075 --> 01:24:10,609
Get on your knees!

1030
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:13,412
Get down, get down!
Get on your knees!

1031
01:24:13,413 --> 01:24:15,014
Down!

1032
01:24:15,015 --> 01:24:16,559
Don't move.

1033
01:24:23,023 --> 01:24:24,590
Put the gun down.

1034
01:24:24,591 --> 01:24:27,034
Not here. Not here!

1035
01:24:41,940 --> 01:24:43,518
<i>It was him.</i>

1036
01:24:46,311 --> 01:24:50,222
He looked right at me like
he didn't even know me.

1037
01:24:50,349 --> 01:24:53,217
How is that even possible?
It was, like, 70 years ago.

1038
01:24:53,218 --> 01:24:54,686
Zola.

1039
01:24:54,687 --> 01:24:56,454
Bucky's whole unit
was captured in '43.

1040
01:24:56,455 --> 01:24:58,556
Zola experimented on him.

1041
01:24:58,557 --> 01:25:01,262
Whatever he did helped
Bucky survive the fall.

1042
01:25:02,594 --> 01:25:03,828
They must have found him and...

1043
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:06,238
None of that's your fault, Steve.

1044
01:25:09,468 --> 01:25:11,672
Even when I had
nothing, I had Bucky.

1045
01:25:14,506 --> 01:25:16,407
We need to get a doctor here.

1046
01:25:16,408 --> 01:25:17,675
If we don't put
pressure on that wound,

1047
01:25:17,676 --> 01:25:19,380
she's gonna bleed out
here in the truck.

1048
01:25:27,051 --> 01:25:30,188
That thing was squeezing my brain.

1049
01:25:32,590 --> 01:25:34,191
Who is this guy?

1050
01:25:44,669 --> 01:25:47,180
Three holes. Start digging.

1051
01:26:13,631 --> 01:26:15,731
GSW. She's lost at least a pint.

1052
01:26:15,732 --> 01:26:17,233
Maybe two.

1053
01:26:17,234 --> 01:26:19,780
- Let me take her.
- She'll want to see him first.

1054
01:26:29,112 --> 01:26:31,885
About damn time.

1055
01:26:33,283 --> 01:26:35,385
Lacerated spinal column,

1056
01:26:35,619 --> 01:26:36,886
cracked sternum,

1057
01:26:36,887 --> 01:26:38,587
shattered collarbone,

1058
01:26:38,588 --> 01:26:40,623
perforated liver,

1059
01:26:40,624 --> 01:26:42,625
and one hell of a headache.

1060
01:26:42,626 --> 01:26:44,093
Don't forget your collapsed lung.

1061
01:26:44,094 --> 01:26:45,694
Let's not forget that.

1062
01:26:45,695 --> 01:26:47,696
Otherwise, I'm good.

1063
01:26:47,697 --> 01:26:49,899
They cut you open.
Your heart stopped.

1064
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,168
Tetrodotoxin B.

1065
01:26:52,169 --> 01:26:54,370
Slows the pulse to
one beat a minute.

1066
01:26:54,371 --> 01:26:56,372
Banner developed it for stress.

1067
01:26:56,373 --> 01:26:59,141
Didn't work so great for him,
but we found a use for it.

1068
01:26:59,142 --> 01:27:01,210
Why all the secrecy?
Why not just tell us?

1069
01:27:01,211 --> 01:27:03,946
Any attempt on the Director's
life had to look successful.

1070
01:27:03,947 --> 01:27:06,581
Can't kill you if
you're already dead.

1071
01:27:06,582 --> 01:27:08,217
Besides,

1072
01:27:08,851 --> 01:27:10,953
I wasn't sure who to trust.

1073
01:27:25,901 --> 01:27:27,844
Sergeant Barnes.

1074
01:27:29,505 --> 01:27:31,049
Bucky, no!

1075
01:27:34,143 --> 01:27:37,747
<i>The procedure has already started.</i>

1076
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:45,186
<i>You are to be the
new fist of HYDRA.</i>

1077
01:27:45,187 --> 01:27:46,731
<i>Put him on ice.</i>

1078
01:27:57,665 --> 01:27:59,209
Sir.

1079
01:27:59,334 --> 01:28:01,277
He's unstable.

1080
01:28:01,302 --> 01:28:03,142
Erratic.

1081
01:28:15,884 --> 01:28:17,519
Mission report.

1082
01:28:20,622 --> 01:28:22,360
Mission report now.

1083
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:36,613
The man on the bridge.

1084
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:41,046
Who was he?

1085
01:28:41,843 --> 01:28:44,650
You met him earlier this
week on another assignment.

1086
01:28:47,247 --> 01:28:49,190
I knew him.

1087
01:28:57,224 --> 01:29:00,270
Your work has been
a gift to mankind.

1088
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:04,106
You shaped the century.

1089
01:29:04,264 --> 01:29:07,174
And I need you to do
it one more time.

1090
01:29:07,935 --> 01:29:11,771
Society's at a tipping point
between order and chaos.

1091
01:29:11,772 --> 01:29:15,114
And tomorrow morning,
we're gonna give it a push.

1092
01:29:15,742 --> 01:29:19,323
But, if you don't do your
part, I can't do mine.

1093
01:29:20,614 --> 01:29:23,956
And HYDRA can't give the world
the freedom it deserves.

1094
01:29:26,453 --> 01:29:28,464
But I knew him.

1095
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,294
Prep him.

1096
01:29:36,295 --> 01:29:39,030
He's been out of cryo
freeze too long.

1097
01:29:39,031 --> 01:29:41,577
Then wipe him and start over.

1098
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:26,914
This man declined the
Nobel Peace Prize.

1099
01:30:27,078 --> 01:30:30,748
He said peace wasn't
an achievement,

1100
01:30:30,749 --> 01:30:33,351
it was a responsibility.

1101
01:30:33,818 --> 01:30:37,661
See, it's stuff like this
that gives me trust issues.

1102
01:30:37,856 --> 01:30:39,662
We have to stop the launch.

1103
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:43,331
I don't think the Council's
accepting my calls anymore.

1104
01:30:45,430 --> 01:30:46,764
What's that?

1105
01:30:46,765 --> 01:30:49,666
Once the helicarriers
reach 3,000 feet,

1106
01:30:49,667 --> 01:30:53,407
they'll triangulate with Insight
satellites, becoming fully weaponized.

1107
01:30:53,738 --> 01:30:55,572
We need to breach those carriers

1108
01:30:55,573 --> 01:30:58,142
and replace their targeting
blades with our own.

1109
01:30:58,143 --> 01:30:59,376
One or two won't cut it.

1110
01:30:59,377 --> 01:31:02,012
We need to link all three
carriers for this to work,

1111
01:31:02,013 --> 01:31:05,649
because if even one of those
ships remains operational,

1112
01:31:05,650 --> 01:31:07,651
a whole lot of people
are gonna die.

1113
01:31:07,652 --> 01:31:11,088
We have to assume everyone
aboard those carriers is HYDRA.

1114
01:31:11,089 --> 01:31:13,457
We have to get past them,
insert these server blades.

1115
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:16,626
And maybe, just maybe we
can salvage what's left...

1116
01:31:16,627 --> 01:31:17,860
We're not salvaging anything.

1117
01:31:17,861 --> 01:31:19,395
We're not just taking
down the carriers, Nick.

1118
01:31:19,396 --> 01:31:20,530
We're taking down S.H.I.E.L.D.

1119
01:31:20,531 --> 01:31:21,931
S.H.I.E.L.D. had nothing
to do with this.

1120
01:31:21,932 --> 01:31:24,300
You gave me this mission.
This is how it ends.

1121
01:31:24,301 --> 01:31:26,702
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s been compromised.
You said so yourself.

1122
01:31:26,703 --> 01:31:28,571
HYDRA grew right under your
nose and nobody noticed.

1123
01:31:28,572 --> 01:31:31,941
Why do you think we're meeting
in this cave? I noticed.

1124
01:31:31,942 --> 01:31:34,146
How many paid the
price before you did?

1125
01:31:36,647 --> 01:31:38,614
Look, I didn't know about Barnes.

1126
01:31:38,615 --> 01:31:40,592
Even if you had, would
you have told me?

1127
01:31:40,684 --> 01:31:43,653
Or would you have
compartmentalized that, too?

1128
01:31:43,654 --> 01:31:46,656
S.H.I.E.L.D., HYDRA,

1129
01:31:46,657 --> 01:31:48,463
it all goes.

1130
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:50,203
He's right.

1131
01:31:55,566 --> 01:31:56,699
Don't look at me.

1132
01:31:56,700 --> 01:31:59,280
I do what he does, just slower.

1133
01:32:02,406 --> 01:32:04,508
Well...

1134
01:32:10,279 --> 01:32:13,291
It looks like you're giving
the orders now, Captain.

1135
01:32:24,360 --> 01:32:26,268
<i>We looked for you, after.</i>

1136
01:32:27,096 --> 01:32:29,331
<i>My folks wanted to give you
a ride to the cemetery.</i>

1137
01:32:29,332 --> 01:32:33,345
I know, I'm sorry. I just
kind of wanted to be alone.

1138
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:35,804
How was it?

1139
01:32:35,805 --> 01:32:37,739
It was okay.

1140
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:40,149
She's next to Dad.

1141
01:32:41,210 --> 01:32:42,811
I was gonna ask...

1142
01:32:42,812 --> 01:32:44,914
I know what you're gonna
say, Buck. I just...

1143
01:32:45,581 --> 01:32:47,215
We can put the couch
cushions on the floor

1144
01:32:47,216 --> 01:32:49,193
like when we were kids.

1145
01:32:49,485 --> 01:32:52,387
It'll be fun. All you got
to do is shine my shoes,

1146
01:32:52,388 --> 01:32:54,490
maybe take out the trash.

1147
01:32:59,027 --> 01:33:01,072
Come on.

1148
01:33:03,565 --> 01:33:07,374
Thank you, Buck, but I
can get by on my own.

1149
01:33:07,602 --> 01:33:12,116
The thing is, you don't have to.

1150
01:33:14,776 --> 01:33:16,980
I'm with you to the
end of the line, pal.

1151
01:33:19,681 --> 01:33:21,182
He's gonna be there, you know.

1152
01:33:21,183 --> 01:33:22,761
I know.

1153
01:33:23,084 --> 01:33:27,029
Look, whoever he used to
be and the guy he is now,

1154
01:33:27,088 --> 01:33:29,557
I don't think he's
the kind you save.

1155
01:33:29,558 --> 01:33:31,398
He's the kind you stop.

1156
01:33:33,695 --> 01:33:35,596
I don't know if I can do that.

1157
01:33:35,597 --> 01:33:37,598
Well, he might not
give you a choice.

1158
01:33:37,599 --> 01:33:39,701
He doesn't know you.

1159
01:33:39,801 --> 01:33:41,379
He will.

1160
01:33:43,605 --> 01:33:45,444
Gear up. It's time.

1161
01:33:47,741 --> 01:33:48,942
You gonna wear that?

1162
01:33:48,943 --> 01:33:52,922
No. If you're gonna fight a
war, you got to wear a uniform.

1163
01:34:00,287 --> 01:34:02,127
Oh, man.

1164
01:34:02,523 --> 01:34:05,160
I am so fired.

1165
01:34:29,516 --> 01:34:32,118
<i>We are in final launch sequence.</i>

1166
01:34:33,354 --> 01:34:35,796
We are go on guidance.

1167
01:34:37,223 --> 01:34:39,860
<i>All personnel to launch stations.</i>

1168
01:34:40,059 --> 01:34:41,493
And how was your flight?

1169
01:34:41,494 --> 01:34:42,661
Lovely.

1170
01:34:42,662 --> 01:34:45,197
The ride from the airport, less so.

1171
01:34:45,198 --> 01:34:47,799
Sadly, S.H.I.E.L.D. can't
control everything.

1172
01:34:47,800 --> 01:34:50,209
Including Captain America.

1173
01:34:53,206 --> 01:34:55,941
This facility is
biometrically controlled.

1174
01:34:55,942 --> 01:34:59,352
And these will give you
unrestricted access.

1175
01:35:02,782 --> 01:35:04,216
I've been parking
there for two months.

1176
01:35:04,217 --> 01:35:05,984
- But it's his spot.
- So where's he been?

1177
01:35:05,985 --> 01:35:07,352
I think Afghanistan.

1178
01:35:07,353 --> 01:35:09,621
Negative DT Six.
The pattern is full.

1179
01:35:09,622 --> 01:35:11,326
Well, he could've said something.

1180
01:35:12,558 --> 01:35:14,262
Must be the dish.

1181
01:35:15,695 --> 01:35:17,797
I'll check it out.

1182
01:35:17,997 --> 01:35:21,544
<i>Triskelion command request we
clear the area for launch.</i>

1183
01:35:24,604 --> 01:35:25,703
Excuse us.

1184
01:35:25,704 --> 01:35:28,639
<i>I know the road hasn't
exactly been smooth,</i>

1185
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,551
and some of you would have gladly
kicked me out of the car along the way.

1186
01:35:34,313 --> 01:35:35,823
Finally, we're here.

1187
01:35:36,014 --> 01:35:38,457
And the world should be grateful.

1188
01:35:38,884 --> 01:35:40,751
<i>Attention all S.H.I.E.L.D. agents,</i>

1189
01:35:40,752 --> 01:35:43,195
<i>this is Steve Rogers.</i>

1190
01:35:44,423 --> 01:35:47,230
<i>You've heard a lot about
me over the last few days.</i>

1191
01:35:47,726 --> 01:35:50,328
<i>Some of you were even
ordered to hunt me down.</i>

1192
01:35:50,696 --> 01:35:54,072
But I think it's time
you know the truth.

1193
01:35:56,702 --> 01:35:58,936
S.H.I.E.L.D. is not
what we thought it was.

1194
01:35:58,937 --> 01:36:01,312
It's been taken over by HYDRA.

1195
01:36:01,740 --> 01:36:04,081
<i>Alexander Pierce is their leader.</i>

1196
01:36:07,679 --> 01:36:10,181
<i>The S.T.R.I.K.E. and Insight
crew are HYDRA as well.</i>

1197
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:11,726
<i>I don't know how many more,</i>

1198
01:36:12,584 --> 01:36:14,128
but I know they're in the building.

1199
01:36:15,319 --> 01:36:17,694
<i>They could be standing
right next to you.</i>

1200
01:36:18,656 --> 01:36:20,997
<i>They almost have what they want.</i>

1201
01:36:21,192 --> 01:36:23,727
<i>Absolute control.</i>

1202
01:36:23,728 --> 01:36:25,671
They shot Nick Fury.

1203
01:36:26,263 --> 01:36:27,831
<i>And it won't end there.</i>

1204
01:36:27,832 --> 01:36:30,333
If you launch those
helicarriers today,

1205
01:36:30,334 --> 01:36:32,845
<i>HYDRA will be able to kill
anyone that stands in their way.</i>

1206
01:36:35,639 --> 01:36:37,411
<i>Unless we stop them.</i>

1207
01:36:40,878 --> 01:36:42,582
<i>I know I'm asking a lot.</i>

1208
01:36:44,014 --> 01:36:47,720
<i>But the price of freedom
is high. It always has been.</i>

1209
01:36:47,885 --> 01:36:50,260
And it's a price I'm
willing to pay.

1210
01:36:52,223 --> 01:36:55,463
And if I'm the only
one, then so be it.

1211
01:36:56,727 --> 01:36:58,965
But I'm willing to bet I'm not.

1212
01:37:03,134 --> 01:37:07,044
Did you write that down first, or
was it off the top of your head?

1213
01:37:07,070 --> 01:37:09,274
You smug son of a bitch.

1214
01:37:12,742 --> 01:37:14,150
Arrest him.

1215
01:37:16,679 --> 01:37:18,724
I guess I've got the floor.

1216
01:37:25,088 --> 01:37:28,498
Preempt the launch sequence.
Send those ships up now.

1217
01:37:32,462 --> 01:37:34,405
Is there a problem?

1218
01:37:38,902 --> 01:37:40,202
Is there a problem?

1219
01:37:40,203 --> 01:37:41,804
I'm sorry, sir.

1220
01:37:49,979 --> 01:37:52,718
I'm not gonna launch those ships.

1221
01:37:54,883 --> 01:37:56,484
Captain's orders.

1222
01:37:56,485 --> 01:37:58,052
Move away from your station.

1223
01:37:58,053 --> 01:37:59,287
Like he said...

1224
01:37:59,288 --> 01:38:00,455
Hold it right there.

1225
01:38:00,456 --> 01:38:01,856
Put the gun down!

1226
01:38:01,857 --> 01:38:03,401
Captain's orders.

1227
01:38:05,327 --> 01:38:07,167
You picked the wrong side, Agent.

1228
01:38:08,597 --> 01:38:10,699
Depends on where you're standing.

1229
01:38:54,609 --> 01:38:56,243
Close the bay door!

1230
01:38:56,244 --> 01:38:57,878
Close the bay door now!

1231
01:38:57,879 --> 01:38:59,389
Close the bay door!

1232
01:39:18,633 --> 01:39:20,439
They're initiating launch.

1233
01:39:40,186 --> 01:39:42,922
Hey, Cap, how do we know the
good guys from the bad guys?

1234
01:39:42,923 --> 01:39:45,025
If they're shooting
at you, they're bad.

1235
01:40:17,724 --> 01:40:18,958
Hey, Cap,

1236
01:40:18,959 --> 01:40:21,093
I found those bad guys
you were talking about.

1237
01:40:21,094 --> 01:40:22,638
You okay?

1238
01:40:24,230 --> 01:40:26,206
I'm not dead yet.

1239
01:40:32,638 --> 01:40:35,047
Let me ask you a question.

1240
01:40:36,976 --> 01:40:40,614
What if Pakistan marched
into Mumbai tomorrow

1241
01:40:41,480 --> 01:40:43,681
and you knew that they were
going to drag your daughters

1242
01:40:43,682 --> 01:40:47,126
into a soccer stadium
for execution,

1243
01:40:48,921 --> 01:40:52,557
and you could just stop it,
with a flick of the switch.

1244
01:40:52,558 --> 01:40:53,791
Wouldn't you?

1245
01:40:53,792 --> 01:40:56,099
Wouldn't you all?

1246
01:40:57,429 --> 01:40:59,337
Not if it was your switch.

1247
01:41:23,488 --> 01:41:25,260
I'm sorry.

1248
01:41:30,995 --> 01:41:33,199
Did I step on your moment?

1249
01:41:34,165 --> 01:41:37,006
Satellites in range at 3,000 feet.

1250
01:41:37,402 --> 01:41:38,735
Falcon, status?

1251
01:41:38,736 --> 01:41:40,474
Engaging.

1252
01:42:04,028 --> 01:42:05,935
All right, Cap. I'm in.

1253
01:42:07,631 --> 01:42:09,209
Oh, shit.

1254
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:41,202
<i>Eight minutes, Cap.</i>

1255
01:42:41,264 --> 01:42:43,275
Working on it.

1256
01:42:50,974 --> 01:42:52,108
What are you doing?

1257
01:42:52,109 --> 01:42:53,709
She's disabling security protocols

1258
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:55,677
and dumping all the secrets
onto the Internet.

1259
01:42:55,678 --> 01:42:57,882
- Including HYDRA'S.
- And S.H.I.E.L.D.'s.

1260
01:42:58,547 --> 01:42:59,948
If you do this,

1261
01:42:59,949 --> 01:43:02,290
none of your past is
gonna remain hidden.

1262
01:43:04,687 --> 01:43:07,522
Are you sure you're ready
for the world to see you

1263
01:43:07,523 --> 01:43:09,500
as you really are?

1264
01:43:09,692 --> 01:43:11,703
Are you?

1265
01:43:27,510 --> 01:43:29,054
Alpha lock.

1266
01:43:30,713 --> 01:43:32,080
Falcon, where are you now?

1267
01:43:32,081 --> 01:43:33,489
I had to take a detour.

1268
01:44:05,713 --> 01:44:07,724
Oh, yeah!

1269
01:44:13,188 --> 01:44:14,789
I'm in.

1270
01:44:17,792 --> 01:44:20,133
Bravo lock.

1271
01:44:21,563 --> 01:44:23,267
Two down, one to go.

1272
01:44:25,066 --> 01:44:27,168
All S.H.I.E.L.D. pilots, scramble.

1273
01:44:27,502 --> 01:44:30,548
We're the only air support
Captain Rogers has got.

1274
01:45:12,646 --> 01:45:15,481
Disabling the encryption
is an executive order.

1275
01:45:15,482 --> 01:45:17,316
It takes two Alpha Level members.

1276
01:45:17,317 --> 01:45:19,828
Don't worry. Company's coming.

1277
01:45:42,842 --> 01:45:44,477
Did you get my flowers?

1278
01:45:46,646 --> 01:45:48,987
- I'm glad you're here, Nick.
- Really?

1279
01:45:50,383 --> 01:45:52,484
Because I thought
you had me killed.

1280
01:45:52,485 --> 01:45:54,393
You know how the game works.

1281
01:45:54,921 --> 01:45:56,688
So why make me head
of S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1282
01:45:56,689 --> 01:45:58,223
Because you were the best,

1283
01:45:58,224 --> 01:45:59,991
and the most ruthless
person I ever met.

1284
01:45:59,992 --> 01:46:02,765
I did what I did to protect people.

1285
01:46:03,129 --> 01:46:05,640
Our enemies are your enemies, Nick.

1286
01:46:05,998 --> 01:46:08,908
Disorder. War.

1287
01:46:09,402 --> 01:46:11,836
It's just a matter of time before
a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow,

1288
01:46:11,837 --> 01:46:14,542
or an EMP fries Chicago.

1289
01:46:15,707 --> 01:46:17,241
Diplomacy?

1290
01:46:17,242 --> 01:46:20,152
A holding action, Nick. A band-aid.

1291
01:46:20,512 --> 01:46:23,956
And you know where I
learned that. Bogota.

1292
01:46:25,116 --> 01:46:28,287
You didn't ask. You just
did what had to be done.

1293
01:46:28,987 --> 01:46:33,899
I can bring order to the lives
of seven billion people

1294
01:46:34,025 --> 01:46:36,263
by sacrificing 20 million.

1295
01:46:37,228 --> 01:46:39,396
It's the next step, Nick.

1296
01:46:39,397 --> 01:46:40,597
If you have the courage to take it.

1297
01:46:40,598 --> 01:46:43,235
No. I have the courage not to.

1298
01:46:47,339 --> 01:46:49,748
<i>Retinal scanner active.</i>

1299
01:46:50,608 --> 01:46:53,277
You don't think we've wiped
your clearance from the system?

1300
01:46:53,278 --> 01:46:55,446
I know you erased my password.

1301
01:46:55,447 --> 01:46:57,781
Probably deleted my retinal scan.

1302
01:46:57,782 --> 01:47:01,192
But if you want to stay
ahead of me, Mr. Secretary,

1303
01:47:04,589 --> 01:47:08,294
you need to keep both eyes open.

1304
01:47:12,062 --> 01:47:14,063
<i>Alpha level confirmed.</i>

1305
01:47:14,064 --> 01:47:16,099
<i>Encryption code accepted.</i>

1306
01:47:16,100 --> 01:47:17,567
<i>Safeguards removed.</i>

1307
01:47:17,568 --> 01:47:21,308
Charlie carrier is 45
degrees off the port bow.

1308
01:47:26,410 --> 01:47:27,710
Six minutes.

1309
01:47:27,711 --> 01:47:30,552
Hey, Sam, gonna need a ride.

1310
01:47:30,881 --> 01:47:33,222
Roger. Let me know
when you're ready.

1311
01:47:35,219 --> 01:47:36,991
I just did!

1312
01:47:54,238 --> 01:47:56,338
You know, you're a lot
heavier than you look.

1313
01:47:56,339 --> 01:47:57,940
I had a big breakfast.

1314
01:48:00,043 --> 01:48:01,951
Steve!

1315
01:48:31,741 --> 01:48:33,708
<i>Cap! Cap, come in. Are you okay?</i>

1316
01:48:33,709 --> 01:48:35,617
Yeah, I'm here.

1317
01:48:35,711 --> 01:48:37,289
I'm still on the helicarrier.

1318
01:48:37,647 --> 01:48:39,915
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm grounded.</i>

1319
01:48:39,916 --> 01:48:42,860
The suit's down. Sorry, Cap.

1320
01:48:43,119 --> 01:48:45,493
Don't worry. I got it.

1321
01:48:46,988 --> 01:48:48,622
<i>Emergency evacuation alert.</i>

1322
01:48:48,623 --> 01:48:52,136
<i>All personnel, proceed to
designated safety zones.</i>

1323
01:48:53,261 --> 01:48:55,670
All S.H.I.E.L.D. agents
regroup at Rally Point Delta.

1324
01:49:00,836 --> 01:49:03,337
<i>Sir, the Council's been breached.</i>

1325
01:49:03,338 --> 01:49:05,873
- Repeat, Dispatch.
<i>- Black Widow's up there.</i>

1326
01:49:05,874 --> 01:49:07,817
Headed up.

1327
01:49:09,511 --> 01:49:10,744
- Falcon?
- Yeah.

1328
01:49:10,745 --> 01:49:11,846
Rumlow's headed for the Council.

1329
01:49:11,847 --> 01:49:13,391
I'm on it.

1330
01:49:24,526 --> 01:49:26,104
People are gonna die, Buck.

1331
01:49:27,696 --> 01:49:29,604
I can't let that happen.

1332
01:49:37,638 --> 01:49:39,410
Please don't make me do this.

1333
01:50:48,942 --> 01:50:50,452
Done.

1334
01:50:51,144 --> 01:50:52,688
And it's trending.

1335
01:50:59,719 --> 01:51:01,620
Unless you want a two-inch
hole in your sternum,

1336
01:51:01,621 --> 01:51:03,256
I'd put that gun down.

1337
01:51:05,625 --> 01:51:08,068
That was armed the
moment you pinned it on.

1338
01:51:41,293 --> 01:51:42,928
Drop it!

1339
01:51:42,995 --> 01:51:44,539
Drop it!

1340
01:52:04,583 --> 01:52:08,220
I'm on 41, headed toward
the southwest stairwell.

1341
01:52:14,558 --> 01:52:16,603
This is gonna hurt.

1342
01:52:17,428 --> 01:52:20,597
There are no prisoners
with HYDRA. Just order.

1343
01:52:20,598 --> 01:52:23,337
And order only comes through pain.

1344
01:52:24,335 --> 01:52:27,108
- You ready for yours?
- Man, shut the hell up.

1345
01:52:28,539 --> 01:52:29,873
Lieutenant, how much longer?

1346
01:52:29,874 --> 01:52:32,042
<i>65 seconds to satellite link.</i>

1347
01:52:32,043 --> 01:52:35,590
Targeting grid engaged.
Lowering weapons array now.

1348
01:52:39,016 --> 01:52:40,651
One minute.

1349
01:53:00,036 --> 01:53:02,240
<i>30 seconds, Cap.</i>

1350
01:53:03,239 --> 01:53:04,977
Stand by.

1351
01:53:07,510 --> 01:53:09,555
Charlie...

1352
01:53:18,388 --> 01:53:20,228
<i>We've reached 3,000 feet.</i>

1353
01:53:20,557 --> 01:53:22,295
Sat link coming online now.

1354
01:53:24,227 --> 01:53:25,805
Deploy algorithm.

1355
01:53:26,963 --> 01:53:28,564
Algorithm deployed.

1356
01:53:29,399 --> 01:53:31,307
<i>We are go to target.</i>

1357
01:53:49,785 --> 01:53:51,719
<i>Target saturation reached.</i>

1358
01:53:51,720 --> 01:53:52,620
All targets assigned.

1359
01:53:52,621 --> 01:53:54,165
Fire when ready.

1360
01:53:56,225 --> 01:53:57,692
Firing in...

1361
01:53:57,693 --> 01:53:58,893
<i>Three,</i>

1362
01:53:58,894 --> 01:54:00,438
two...

1363
01:54:01,130 --> 01:54:03,107
One.

1364
01:54:05,134 --> 01:54:06,534
Charlie lock.

1365
01:54:06,535 --> 01:54:08,273
Where are the targets?

1366
01:54:09,138 --> 01:54:10,705
Where are the targets?

1367
01:54:10,706 --> 01:54:12,512
Okay, Cap, get out of there.

1368
01:54:29,458 --> 01:54:31,036
Fire now.

1369
01:54:31,593 --> 01:54:33,194
- But, Steve...
- Do it!

1370
01:54:33,595 --> 01:54:35,138
<i>Do it now!</i>

1371
01:55:05,226 --> 01:55:06,460
What a waste.

1372
01:55:06,461 --> 01:55:09,729
So, you still on the fence
about Rogers' chances?

1373
01:55:09,730 --> 01:55:13,277
Time to go, Councilwoman.
This way. Come on.

1374
01:55:13,401 --> 01:55:15,035
You're going to fly me out of here.

1375
01:55:15,036 --> 01:55:18,505
You know, there was a time I
would've taken a bullet for you.

1376
01:55:18,506 --> 01:55:19,873
You already did.

1377
01:55:19,874 --> 01:55:22,317
You will again, when it's useful.

1378
01:55:35,188 --> 01:55:36,892
Romanoff.

1379
01:55:37,057 --> 01:55:38,658
Natasha.

1380
01:55:40,227 --> 01:55:42,534
Natasha! Come on!

1381
01:55:49,035 --> 01:55:51,205
Those really do sting.

1382
01:56:23,536 --> 01:56:25,547
Hail HYDRA.

1383
01:57:20,592 --> 01:57:22,500
You're out of your depth, kid.

1384
01:57:25,597 --> 01:57:27,733
Son of a bitch!

1385
01:57:39,344 --> 01:57:41,389
Please tell me you got
that chopper in the air!

1386
01:57:41,613 --> 01:57:43,248
<i>Sam, where are you?</i>

1387
01:57:43,615 --> 01:57:45,649
41st floor! Northwest corner!

1388
01:57:45,650 --> 01:57:47,551
We're on it! Stay where you are!

1389
01:57:47,552 --> 01:57:49,187
Not an option!

1390
01:58:03,433 --> 01:58:05,835
41st floor! 41st!

1391
01:58:05,836 --> 01:58:09,815
It's not like they put the floor numbers
on the outside of the building.

1392
01:58:10,707 --> 01:58:13,651
Hill! Where's Steve? You
got a location on Rogers?

1393
01:58:29,660 --> 01:58:31,261
You know me.

1394
01:58:32,496 --> 01:58:34,200
No, I don't!

1395
01:58:43,306 --> 01:58:45,213
Bucky.

1396
01:58:46,075 --> 01:58:48,177
You've known me your whole life.

1397
01:58:55,051 --> 01:58:59,254
Your name is James Buchanan Barnes.

1398
01:58:59,255 --> 01:59:01,027
Shut up!

1399
01:59:09,165 --> 01:59:11,267
I'm not gonna fight you.

1400
01:59:14,537 --> 01:59:16,445
You're my friend.

1401
01:59:22,912 --> 01:59:24,923
You're my mission.

1402
01:59:26,549 --> 01:59:29,254
You're my mission!

1403
01:59:31,987 --> 01:59:33,531
Then finish it.

1404
01:59:36,524 --> 01:59:39,263
Because I'm with you to
the end of the line.

1405
02:01:50,389 --> 02:01:52,127
On your left.

1406
02:02:42,574 --> 02:02:45,242
<i>Do you solemnly swear to tell
the truth, the whole truth,</i>

1407
02:02:45,243 --> 02:02:46,610
<i>and nothing but the truth?</i>

1408
02:02:46,611 --> 02:02:48,417
<i>I do.</i>

1409
02:02:49,948 --> 02:02:52,289
<i>Why haven't we yet heard
from Captain Rogers?</i>

1410
02:02:54,452 --> 02:02:56,586
I don't know what there
is left for him to say.

1411
02:02:56,587 --> 02:02:58,655
I think the wreck in the
middle of the Potomac

1412
02:02:58,656 --> 02:02:59,889
made his point fairly eloquently.

1413
02:02:59,890 --> 02:03:01,090
Well, he could explain how

1414
02:03:01,091 --> 02:03:03,826
this country is expected to
maintain its national security

1415
02:03:03,827 --> 02:03:08,464
now that he and you have laid waste
to our intelligence apparatus.

1416
02:03:08,465 --> 02:03:10,600
HYDRA was selling you
lies, not intelligence.

1417
02:03:10,601 --> 02:03:13,703
Many of which you seemed to have
had a personal hand in telling.

1418
02:03:13,704 --> 02:03:15,004
Agent, you should know

1419
02:03:15,005 --> 02:03:16,839
that there are some
on this committee

1420
02:03:16,840 --> 02:03:19,208
who feel, given your
service record,

1421
02:03:19,209 --> 02:03:21,413
both for this country
and against it,

1422
02:03:21,612 --> 02:03:23,579
that you belong in a penitentiary.

1423
02:03:23,580 --> 02:03:26,285
Not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.

1424
02:03:27,651 --> 02:03:29,628
You're not going to
put me in a prison.

1425
02:03:30,120 --> 02:03:34,532
You're not going to put any of
us in a prison. You know why?

1426
02:03:35,559 --> 02:03:37,160
Do enlighten us.

1427
02:03:37,161 --> 02:03:39,104
Because you need us.

1428
02:03:39,530 --> 02:03:42,098
<i>Yes, the world is a
vulnerable place,</i>

1429
02:03:42,099 --> 02:03:44,734
<i>and yes, we help make it that way.</i>

1430
02:03:44,735 --> 02:03:48,178
<i>But we're also the ones best
qualified to defend it.</i>

1431
02:03:49,238 --> 02:03:51,681
So, if you want to
arrest me, arrest me.

1432
02:03:52,241 --> 02:03:54,377
You'll know where to find me.

1433
02:04:29,379 --> 02:04:32,614
So, you've experienced
this sort of thing before.

1434
02:04:32,615 --> 02:04:34,785
You get used to it.

1435
02:04:36,918 --> 02:04:39,387
We've been data
mining HYDRA'S files.

1436
02:04:39,388 --> 02:04:42,093
Looks like a lot of rats
didn't go down with the ship.

1437
02:04:43,025 --> 02:04:44,968
I'm headed to Europe tonight.

1438
02:04:45,360 --> 02:04:47,200
Wanted to ask if you'd come.

1439
02:04:47,696 --> 02:04:49,934
There's something I
got to do first.

1440
02:04:50,332 --> 02:04:53,310
How about you, Wilson? Could
use a man with your abilities.

1441
02:04:53,802 --> 02:04:56,211
I'm more of a soldier than a spy.

1442
02:04:56,605 --> 02:04:59,048
All right, then.

1443
02:05:03,078 --> 02:05:07,854
Anybody asks for me, tell them
they can find me, right here.

1444
02:05:09,117 --> 02:05:10,851
You should be honored. That's
about as close as he gets

1445
02:05:10,852 --> 02:05:13,090
to saying thank you.

1446
02:05:13,622 --> 02:05:15,223
Not going with him?

1447
02:05:15,290 --> 02:05:16,657
No.

1448
02:05:16,658 --> 02:05:19,204
- Not staying here.
- Nah.

1449
02:05:19,661 --> 02:05:21,929
I blew all my covers. I got
to go figure out a new one.

1450
02:05:21,930 --> 02:05:23,474
That might take a while.

1451
02:05:23,532 --> 02:05:25,576
I'm counting on it.

1452
02:05:27,334 --> 02:05:28,735
That thing you asked for,

1453
02:05:28,736 --> 02:05:31,577
I called in a few favors from Kiev.

1454
02:05:34,008 --> 02:05:37,243
Will you do me a favor?
Call that nurse.

1455
02:05:37,244 --> 02:05:38,545
She's not a nurse.

1456
02:05:38,546 --> 02:05:41,057
And you're not a
S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.

1457
02:05:41,449 --> 02:05:44,051
- What was her name again?
- Sharon.

1458
02:05:44,251 --> 02:05:45,795
She's nice.

1459
02:05:57,598 --> 02:06:00,007
Be careful, Steve.

1460
02:06:00,301 --> 02:06:02,539
You might not want to
pull on that thread.

1461
02:06:13,681 --> 02:06:15,681
You're going after him.

1462
02:06:15,682 --> 02:06:17,216
You don't have to come with me.

1463
02:06:17,217 --> 02:06:18,795
I know.

1464
02:06:20,253 --> 02:06:21,991
When do we start?

1465
02:08:20,705 --> 02:08:25,014
It's over. Fury has released
everything to the public.

1466
02:08:25,142 --> 02:08:27,043
Everything he knows about.

1467
02:08:27,044 --> 02:08:29,079
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, if they get
word of our work here,

1468
02:08:29,080 --> 02:08:31,081
if they find out we serve HYDRA...

1469
02:08:31,082 --> 02:08:33,252
HYDRA, S.H.I.E.L.D.

1470
02:08:33,718 --> 02:08:37,094
Two sides of a coin that's
no longer currency.

1471
02:08:40,524 --> 02:08:42,467
What we have

1472
02:08:43,995 --> 02:08:47,234
is worth more than any
of them ever knew.

1473
02:08:49,299 --> 02:08:53,506
We've only scratched the
surface and already,

1474
02:08:55,672 --> 02:09:00,220
there are other facilities doing
HYDRA'S good work around the world.

1475
02:09:00,744 --> 02:09:04,480
We'll feed them to Captain America
and his colorful friends,

1476
02:09:04,481 --> 02:09:06,515
and keep them off our scent.

1477
02:09:06,516 --> 02:09:08,884
What about the volunteers?

1478
02:09:08,885 --> 02:09:10,552
The dead will be buried so deep

1479
02:09:10,553 --> 02:09:13,258
their own ghosts won't
be able to find them.

1480
02:09:14,858 --> 02:09:16,664
And the survivors?

1481
02:09:18,295 --> 02:09:20,238
The twins.

1482
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:27,004
Sooner or later, they
will meet the twins.

1483
02:09:28,538 --> 02:09:30,739
It's not a world of spies anymore.

1484
02:09:30,740 --> 02:09:33,251
Not even a world of heroes.

1485
02:09:33,677 --> 02:09:37,018
This is the age of
miracles, Doctor.

1486
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:41,290
There's nothing more horrifying

1487
02:09:41,517 --> 02:09:43,221
than a miracle.

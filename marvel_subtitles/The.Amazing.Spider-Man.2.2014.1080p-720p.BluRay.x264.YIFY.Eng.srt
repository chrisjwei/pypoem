1
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,770
People will say I am a
monster for what I've done.

2
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,443
And maybe they're right.

3
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,788
I always thought
that I'd have more...

4
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,207
- time.
- Dad?

5
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,834
Dad!

6
00:02:07,835 --> 00:02:09,236
I'm sorry.

7
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,114
Peter?

8
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,230
He likes to sleep with
the light on at night.

9
00:02:29,231 --> 00:02:31,133
Mary, we have to go.

10
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,059
Dad.

11
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:40,517
Be good.

12
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:52,905
I found a safe place for us to spend
the night at Lake Geneva.

13
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:56,966
- Are you uploading it?
- To Roosevelt. All of it.

14
00:02:56,967 --> 00:02:58,994
Just in case we...

15
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,347
We're gonna be fine, Mary.

16
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:05,016
Did you see his face?
He's never gonna understand.

17
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:07,044
Mary, we've been through this.

18
00:03:07,728 --> 00:03:10,096
Our life as we know it is over.

19
00:03:10,272 --> 00:03:13,892
We're gonna spend every day
from now on looking over our shoulders.

20
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:17,062
Never feeling safe.
We can't do that to him.

21
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,905
He's just a little boy.

22
00:03:18,906 --> 00:03:21,149
I know, I know.
But it's gonna be okay.

23
00:03:23,285 --> 00:03:24,686
It's gonna be all right.

24
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,261
No rest for the weary, huh?

25
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,630
No, I'm afraid not.

26
00:03:44,014 --> 00:03:45,724
Occupational hazard, I guess.

27
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,923
What is it you're working on?

28
00:03:52,356 --> 00:03:55,726
Uh, just planning ahead. Do you
think I could speak with the pilot?

29
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,849
Something you need?

30
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:00,146
Perhaps I can help.

31
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,866
I'd just like to radio ahead
and make sure everything's in order

32
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,439
for when we land.

33
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,496
I think we both know

34
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:10,194
that's not an option, Dr. Parker.

35
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:26,848
Richard.

36
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,251
- They say you're a genius.
- Richard!

37
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:31,770
Not if you thought
you could escape.

38
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,562
Richard!

39
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,049
Mary!

40
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:50,814
Mary!

41
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,801
Mare.

42
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,546
It's okay. It's okay.
That's okay. It's okay.

43
00:05:06,138 --> 00:05:08,848
I got you. I have you, okay? Okay?

44
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,433
Just gonna make you safe.

45
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:13,303
It's done. It's done.
Can you breathe? Mare?

46
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,022
- Roosevelt.
- What?

47
00:05:16,023 --> 00:05:17,515
Roosevelt.

48
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:28,827
- It's back up. It's back up.
- Oh...

49
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,697
It's back up, okay? Hey, hey, hey.

50
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:33,957
We're gonna be all right, okay?
You stay with me.

51
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,730
Whoo!

52
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,352
Ow!

53
00:07:36,413 --> 00:07:38,781
Yee-hee! Hoo-hoo!

54
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,506
What do you got for me today,
New York?

55
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,675
Reporting live from
New York 1 chopper.

56
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:52,136
An Oscorp truck carrying
plutonium has been hijacked.

57
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:54,180
A police chase is in progress.

58
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,958
All right. Let's get to work.

59
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,981
Say hello to Aleksei Sytsevich!

60
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,512
Spider-Man!

61
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:36,381
Hello, pedestrians.

62
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,227
Knock, knock.

63
00:08:56,535 --> 00:08:58,232
Mr. Criminal?

64
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,706
Hey, my name is Spider-Man. You can call
me Web-Head, you can call me Amazing,

65
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,361
just don't call me late for dinner.
You get it? Whoa!

66
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:07,962
Not a shaker? Are you a hugger?

67
00:09:07,963 --> 00:09:10,631
- I am killer!
- Whoa, okay.

68
00:09:10,632 --> 00:09:13,760
Warning. Plutonium-238 is
a radioactive material

69
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,754
and is highly explosive.

70
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:19,724
Excuse me. There's more room on
the sidewalk, folks, please.

71
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,768
- Watch it, man.
- I got blueprints here.

72
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,216
A little help?

73
00:09:23,562 --> 00:09:25,589
A little help, please.

74
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:30,928
You having a problem with your gun?
Let me help you out with that.

75
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,603
Whoa. Coming through.

76
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,940
Too much work...

77
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:38,493
Oh, this is bad.

78
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:40,111
- I'm gonna be right back.
- Aah!

79
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,651
Heads up. Watch out.

80
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:50,046
Whoo... Okay. Okay. There you go.

81
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:53,049
- You okay? You all right?
- You're Spider-Man.

82
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:55,718
Costume gives it away?
These look pretty important, Max.

83
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,678
“Max"? How do you know my name?

84
00:09:57,679 --> 00:09:59,097
It's written on your badge.

85
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,348
I'm a nobody.

86
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,809
Hey, you're not a nobody.
You're a somebody.

87
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,726
Lick that.

88
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:05,311
All right. Listen to me.

89
00:10:05,312 --> 00:10:06,604
- Now I need you.
- Really?

90
00:10:06,605 --> 00:10:08,314
- You're my eyes and ears out here.
- Okay.

91
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,482
- All right?
- All right.

92
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,817
I'll see you out there.

93
00:10:12,152 --> 00:10:15,271
Warning. Violation of protocol.

94
00:10:45,352 --> 00:10:47,049
Hands up!

95
00:10:51,608 --> 00:10:53,305
Get him, Spidey!

96
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,523
Gotcha. Gotcha. Nope. Got you too.

97
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,870
Hey. No. You.
You're not going anywhere.

98
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,773
Come here. Come here.
Come to Daddy.

99
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,209
Get the hell out of the way!

100
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,963
Okay. Stop it! Stop it! Whew.

101
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,832
Oh, come on.

102
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,001
Hey, wait. Come back here.

103
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:21,538
Heel!

104
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,131
I got you.

105
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:38,070
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit
late. I got stuck in some traffic.

106
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:40,114
Your timing is terrible.
It started already.

107
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:41,699
- I know, I'm sorry.
- Where are you?

108
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,659
1st and Broadway, 2nd and
Broadway, 3rd and Broadway.

109
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:45,536
Five minutes. Ten tops.

110
00:11:45,537 --> 00:11:48,456
- Are those sirens?
- No.

111
00:11:48,457 --> 00:11:49,749
- Peter?
- No.

112
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,584
- Peter?
- No sirens.

113
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,328
No...

114
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:55,113
Peter.

115
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,756
What is happening?

116
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,283
Peter.

117
00:11:58,383 --> 00:11:59,830
Peter.

118
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:06,173
Hello?

119
00:12:06,808 --> 00:12:10,478
- Peter? Pe...
- I'll be right there. Promise.

120
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:15,107
This year's Valedictorian,
please welcome Gwen Stacy.

121
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,332
Good morning, esteemed faculty,

122
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:33,584
and families of my
fellow graduates.

123
00:12:33,585 --> 00:12:36,079
It's an honor to be
standing up here today.

124
00:12:42,844 --> 00:12:44,095
Hello.

125
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,763
- Hey! Get off!
- I told you.

126
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,807
I am running a bit late.

127
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,642
It's over, Spider.

128
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,893
Really?!

129
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:53,104
I know we all think
that we're immortal.

130
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,981
We're supposed to feel that way.

131
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,474
We're graduating.

132
00:12:56,858 --> 00:13:00,236
But, like our brief four
years in high school,

133
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,738
what makes life valuable

134
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:05,241
is that it doesn't last forever.

135
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,940
What makes it precious
is that it ends.

136
00:13:09,204 --> 00:13:10,981
And I know that now more than ever.

137
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,034
And I say it,

138
00:13:14,584 --> 00:13:16,782
today of all days,

139
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,664
to remind us that time is luck.

140
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:26,959
So don't waste it
living someone else's life.

141
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,879
Make yours count for something.

142
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:32,101
Fight for what matters to you.

143
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,754
No matter what.

144
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:36,389
Because even if we fall short,

145
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,191
what better way is there to live?

146
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,789
I'll take that. That's not yours.

147
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:58,612
Huh?

148
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,958
This is not end, Spider!

149
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:09,305
Michael Oates.

150
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,844
Julia Orchard-Heymans.

151
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:18,469
Alexis Ortiz.

152
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,430
Bo Parisi.

153
00:14:26,948 --> 00:14:28,520
Peter Parker.

154
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:30,743
Hey, I think I know that guy.

155
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,161
Peter Park...

156
00:14:35,582 --> 00:14:37,108
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:50,304
Ha, ha. Wait, do that again.
Do that again. Oh.

158
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:55,351
Peter, for Lord's sakes, I almost stole
a cap and gown to run up there myself.

159
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:58,771
I'd love to have seen that. That would've
been awesome. No, no, this is for you.

160
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,773
- I am so proud of you.
- You earned it.

161
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:03,552
Sweetheart, I'm so proud of you.

162
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:06,237
I know the first thing
your Uncle Ben would say.

163
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,488
Yeah, I know too.

164
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,866
“You better hurry up, party's over.
You gotta get a job."

165
00:15:10,867 --> 00:15:15,204
The second thing he would say, "Don't
just follow the path, make your own trail."

166
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,705
Ralph Waldo Emerson.

167
00:15:16,706 --> 00:15:18,499
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

168
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,278
- Ben told me he made it up.
- Ha-ha-ha!

169
00:15:21,461 --> 00:15:24,705
You really did
learn something here.

170
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:30,253
I wish your uncle
could have been here.

171
00:15:31,763 --> 00:15:33,665
Yeah, me too.

172
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:35,834
And my folks.

173
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,799
Yeah. Yeah.

174
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:43,599
- Would've been good.
- Perfect d...

175
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:46,193
- All right, you can go. Go on.
- Huh?

176
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:47,445
I'll be right back.

177
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,281
- Is that your program?
- Okay, guys. Get together right now.

178
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,159
A quick one. All right. Cheese.

179
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,994
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

180
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:58,164
- Okay. I'll just be over here.
- Yeah, just give me two seconds.

181
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,999
- Don't go too far.
- It's good to see you.

182
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,868
- All right.
- All right.

183
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,627
Hey.

184
00:16:03,628 --> 00:16:06,797
Did your traffic jam
have anything to do with

185
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:08,924
the Russian Mob

186
00:16:08,925 --> 00:16:12,052
and machine guns by any chance?
Why didn't you just tell me?

187
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,305
What am I gonna do?
You're about to do your speech.

188
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,265
- Gwen. Honey. Family photo.
- Yes?

189
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,349
Okay.

190
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,673
Hey. You coming to dim sum?

191
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,645
Can't keep me away.

192
00:16:21,646 --> 00:16:23,105
It's at 8:00. Don't be late.

193
00:16:23,106 --> 00:16:24,723
- I won't be.
- Okay.

194
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:29,304
And I'm gonna do my speech for you.

195
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,614
All night? I wanna hear
it all night long.

196
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,063
- Over and over again, all night long.
- Okay.

197
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,826
- Oh, my gosh.
- It was pretty good.

198
00:16:35,827 --> 00:16:39,197
Great. Peter. Join us? Come on.

199
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:44,991
I gotta find my aunt, but
I'm gonna catch up later, thank you.

200
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:47,079
Hi.

201
00:16:49,549 --> 00:16:51,667
You're gonna make enemies.

202
00:16:51,801 --> 00:16:53,703
People will get hurt.

203
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,632
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

204
00:16:57,682 --> 00:17:01,757
Leave Gwen out of it.

205
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,515
Promise me that.

206
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,468
She's gonna take
one quick picture, okay?

207
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,654
Peter's outside. I'm gonna
go see if he's okay.

208
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:27,620
What are you doing?
What are you?

209
00:17:29,589 --> 00:17:31,081
Peter.

210
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,249
What is it?

211
00:17:36,846 --> 00:17:38,681
- Hey.
- What's wrong?

212
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:39,974
Are you all right?

213
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,752
I don't know what I'm doing.

214
00:17:43,728 --> 00:17:45,926
It's my father, isn't it?

215
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,439
Yeah.

216
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,733
I see him everywhere I go.

217
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:54,530
I can't... I don't know what to do.
And I can't get him out of my head.

218
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,575
- Yeah, but we've talked about this.
- I know, but, Gwen...

219
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,853
- It's not his choice.
- Gwen.

220
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:03,998
I promised him that
I would keep away from you.

221
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,278
And now I'm gonna come and
eat dinner with your family.

222
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,663
How can I do this?
What does this make me?

223
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:13,007
I don't know,
what does that make you?

224
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,786
It makes me not able to
live with myself.

225
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:22,667
- I thought that it meant you loved me.
- I do love you.

226
00:18:24,477 --> 00:18:26,049
I love you.

227
00:18:27,105 --> 00:18:29,507
Then why isn't that enough?

228
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,983
Huh?

229
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,193
Because what if
something happens to you

230
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:35,946
just like it happened to him
because of me?

231
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:39,366
- No, wait, wait, wait.
- Listen. No, n...

232
00:18:39,367 --> 00:18:41,440
I cannot let that happen.

233
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,162
Listen to me.

234
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,236
You're Spider-Man...

235
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,030
and I love that.

236
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,379
But I love Peter Parker more.

237
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,209
That's worth it to me.

238
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,137
I can't lose you too.

239
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:05,214
If because you can't lose me,
we can't be together,

240
00:19:07,145 --> 00:19:09,798
who does that work out for, Peter?

241
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,227
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen.

242
00:19:16,946 --> 00:19:18,723
Wow.

243
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,492
You have done this to me

244
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:26,080
again and again, Peter.

245
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,734
I can't live like this.

246
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,828
I break up with you.

247
00:19:34,839 --> 00:19:37,333
I break up with you.

248
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,674
Good morning, New Yorkers.

249
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:21,260
Looking for another beautiful day
here in the city.

250
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:22,803
A few clouds to start us off...

251
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,306
The steady increase in sightings
of Spider-Man has sparked a debate

252
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,934
over the role of vigilantism
in American crime fighting.

253
00:20:28,935 --> 00:20:30,185
How about that Spider-Man?

254
00:20:30,186 --> 00:20:32,813
Last night on the Manhattan
Bridge, he saved a dozen lives.

255
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,807
We wanna hear your calls.

256
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:38,235
I think without Spider-Man,
there'd be no hope for this city.

257
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,613
Who do you think pays the bills for
all the damages he causes, huh?

258
00:20:41,614 --> 00:20:42,948
It's you and me, taxpayers.

259
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,896
- You make this?
- Yeah.

260
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,869
This is a wind turbine.

261
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,693
You made this? No way.

262
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:51,365
This is amazing.

263
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,072
It's good as new, right?

264
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,128
I'll walk you home.

265
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,088
- What's your name?
- Jorge.

266
00:20:58,089 --> 00:21:00,549
Jorge? I'm Spider-Man.

267
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:03,719
I don't feel like my kids are
safe with him out there.

268
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,964
Get out of the way and let
the police do their job.

269
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,851
Some folks think that there might
be more than one Spider-Man.

270
00:21:12,353 --> 00:21:13,645
What do you think?

271
00:21:13,646 --> 00:21:15,564
One guy or many?

272
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,650
I'd love to know who's
behind that mask.

273
00:21:18,651 --> 00:21:19,902
Hey.

274
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,612
- Nice outfit.
- Thanks.

275
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,812
We have a caller on the line named Max.
He says he knows Spider-Man.

276
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:28,076
Listen, I'm upset. Spider-Man,
to me, is being misunderstood.

277
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:30,662
He's a very, very good person.
He's protecting us.

278
00:21:30,663 --> 00:21:33,123
He saved my life one time.

279
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:34,616
We sort of became best friends.

280
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:37,711
How much?

281
00:21:37,712 --> 00:21:39,171
Hey, you're that spider guy.

282
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,698
I'm Spider-Man.

283
00:21:40,715 --> 00:21:41,715
Huh?

284
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:47,387
I'm Spider-Man.

285
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:50,516
This Spider-Man... He's not the
police, he's not a fireman.

286
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:53,716
What gives him the right to get
involved in other people's business?

287
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:26,832
Peter, honey?

288
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,846
Can I come in?

289
00:22:30,598 --> 00:22:31,849
No!

290
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,298
Peter, the final
starts at 9, honey.

291
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,478
You said you would
take my car into the shop

292
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:38,188
because it keeps dying, remember?

293
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:41,358
Give me a second, Aunt May. I'm gonna
get the door. Just give me a second.

294
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,402
Peter, please just let me in.
All right?

295
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,653
I'm trying to get my...

296
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:48,073
You said your final was at 9, and
you're gonna take my car into the shop.

297
00:22:48,074 --> 00:22:50,993
- No! You can't come in. I'm so naked.
- What are you do...?

298
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,620
Peter! For goodness sakes.

299
00:22:52,646 --> 00:22:56,874
You said you're gonna take my car
into the shop because it kee...!

300
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,085
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

301
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:01,503
I'm just...

302
00:23:01,504 --> 00:23:03,406
I'm very naked right now.

303
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:05,874
What happened to your face?
It's filthy.

304
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:08,051
- It is?
- Yes.

305
00:23:08,052 --> 00:23:11,251
Oh, yeah, yeah, I was
cleaning the chimney.

306
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,223
We have no chimney.

307
00:23:13,224 --> 00:23:14,725
What?

308
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:16,435
- You're late.
- I know, I'm late.

309
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,312
Downstairs, now.

310
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,466
- Can you leave? Because I'm naked here.
- All right, I'm leaving.

311
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,098
- Morning, I love you.
- I love you too. Hurry up.

312
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,278
Whoa. Well, look who's here.

313
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,851
Spidey.

314
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,657
How was your morning?

315
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,867
Aces, Max, aces.

316
00:24:13,868 --> 00:24:16,161
I've been out saving the world.

317
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,704
Protecting everybody.

318
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:20,858
But is someone celebrating
a birthday today?

319
00:24:22,543 --> 00:24:24,411
That's why you're here.

320
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,421
You remembered my birthday.

321
00:24:28,549 --> 00:24:31,343
All the crime-fighting you've
been doing, and all of a sudden,

322
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:35,248
you take time out to come visit
little old me. Max. It's amazing to...

323
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,300
But of course you would.

324
00:24:38,309 --> 00:24:40,052
Why wouldn't you visit me?

325
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,134
We're best friends.

326
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:48,318
What are you doing?
You made me a cake?

327
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:51,738
People don't get a chance to see these
small, kind things that you do for people.

328
00:24:51,739 --> 00:24:53,782
I know what they say
about you in the press

329
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,159
but it doesn't matter to me.
I know the real you.

330
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,995
Because you're amazing.

331
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:01,289
Wow. That's what the press needs.

332
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:04,534
They should call you
The Amazing Spider-Man.

333
00:25:04,877 --> 00:25:06,620
You like that, Spidey?

334
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,714
I like it a lot, Max.

335
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:11,550
Good. Because today

336
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,343
is going to be

337
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:14,745
amazing.

338
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,507
Yeah. Circuit 39.

339
00:25:21,602 --> 00:25:25,230
I'm not late, Harvey.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

340
00:25:25,231 --> 00:25:28,442
I just wanna know if you
can find another waitress

341
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:31,028
to replace me because I start
my training rounds

342
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,362
at the hospital.

343
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:35,157
And don't mention this to Peter.
I don't want him to know.

344
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,700
Because he'll worry.

345
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:39,327
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Okay, you got it.

346
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,275
Uh, double shift on Thursday.

347
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:43,027
Okay, bye.

348
00:25:45,084 --> 00:25:47,532
- Who was that?
- Harvey.

349
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:51,673
- Doing a double shift, huh?
- Sometimes.

350
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:54,176
Got nothing else to do.
I like the girls.

351
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,956
I miss Ben. Gives me a little extra
in the cookie jar. Heh.

352
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,639
Mm.

353
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,226
Well, I sold another couple of photos
to the Bugle, so that ought to help.

354
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:06,563
Yeah, it would really help if that guy
would pay you a fair wage.

355
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:08,273
Jameson pays me a fair wage.

356
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:10,859
If it was 1961, he
pays me a fair wage.

357
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,529
Hey, wait. What are you doing? What
are you doing? No, I do the laundry.

358
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,782
- I'm doing my laundry.
- No, I do the laundry.

359
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,535
No, this is my job. I've been doing
your laundry since you were 6 years old.

360
00:26:20,536 --> 00:26:22,412
I understand that.
I'm in college now.

361
00:26:22,413 --> 00:26:25,373
I think it's time that I took care of
my own dirty underwear.

362
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:28,126
Last time you did the laundry,
you turned everything blue and red

363
00:26:28,127 --> 00:26:29,377
- so no.
- That was a mistake.

364
00:26:29,378 --> 00:26:32,631
Because I was washing
the American flag.

365
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,926
- My... Can I please just...?
- No one washes a flag.

366
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,177
I do, and I won't anymore.

367
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,429
- This is my machine.
- Fine. It's just underwear.

368
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:42,099
This is my laundry, my home,
my machine.

369
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,797
Back off, eat your breakfast.

370
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:48,522
All right, laundry sheriff.
I'll do it later.

371
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,107
- I'll do it.
- No, forget it.

372
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,150
- Give it to me.
- I'll do it some other time.

373
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:54,778
- Hey.
- Excuse me.

374
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,271
Jerk.

375
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,391
Not gonna make it.

376
00:27:02,036 --> 00:27:05,064
Logjam. Come on, come on, come on.

377
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,196
- Watch it, buddy.
- Hey, let's go.

378
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,172
Oscorp Industries

379
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:18,927
is proud to announce the world's
first electromagnetic power grid.

380
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:23,431
By converting aging power stations
into a field of hydroelectric towers,

381
00:27:23,432 --> 00:27:27,185
we are generating clean, green,
sustainable energy

382
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:29,896
to power Manhattan,
the five boroughs

383
00:27:29,897 --> 00:27:32,440
and eventually the world
for generations to come.

384
00:27:32,441 --> 00:27:35,694
- Dillon. You're late.
- Doggone trains are so slow, sir.

385
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,779
Don't you realize Oscorp
is now responsible

386
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,573
for the entire city's
energy supply?

387
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,783
I submitted a lot of designs
for the power grid

388
00:27:41,784 --> 00:27:44,161
and they used a lot of them,
and I noticed that,

389
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,065
and those power grids
were designed by me.

390
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,487
You designed them?

391
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,792
Sure you did.

392
00:27:50,793 --> 00:27:52,615
And I'm Spider-Man.

393
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,755
You're no Spider-Man!
He's a Leo, you're a Sagittarius!

394
00:27:55,756 --> 00:27:59,285
You besmirch him again, I'm gonna
rip your well-groomed head off!

395
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,503
Now, get to work.

396
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:04,890
What floor, please?

397
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,510
- Seventy-four.
- Thank you.

398
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:09,044
Oh, hold that!

399
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,354
- Can you hold that, please?
- I got it.

400
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:13,565
Thank you, you're a real gentleman.

401
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,609
Most people would have
just let those close.

402
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,485
Most people
don't notice other people.

403
00:28:17,486 --> 00:28:20,113
- What floor, please?
- Um, ahem... Sixty-three...

404
00:28:20,114 --> 00:28:21,948
I got it. I got it. What is it?

405
00:28:21,949 --> 00:28:23,396
Uh, sixty-three.

406
00:28:23,534 --> 00:28:25,368
Sixty-three, please.

407
00:28:25,369 --> 00:28:26,661
- Thank you.
- In a hurry.

408
00:28:26,662 --> 00:28:29,206
Thank you very much.

409
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:35,170
Um... I'm Max. Max Dillon.

410
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,755
I'm Gwen.

411
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,954
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

412
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,411
Is it your birthday?

413
00:28:42,803 --> 00:28:46,473
Oh, yeah. Well, I... They... Friends
of mine made this flyer up.

414
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,558
I'm having a birthday
party at a big club.

415
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,268
- A lot of celebrities.
- Wow.

416
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:53,563
Would love to invite you, it's
just that the guest list is closed.

417
00:28:53,564 --> 00:28:56,983
Oh, got it. Got it.
Well, thank you anyway.

418
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:58,902
- That's exciting.
- ...dressed as Spider-Man

419
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,445
hanging out near the blaze.

420
00:29:00,446 --> 00:29:04,271
It must be cool, huh? To have
the whole world look at you like that?

421
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,736
You know, Spider-Man
saved my life one time.

422
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:10,664
Out of all the people
in the whole city, he saved

423
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:12,066
me.

424
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,950
He said he needed me.

425
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,204
That must be a good feeling.

426
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,744
Sixty-third floor.

427
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:22,243
Oh. It was nice to meet you, Max.

428
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,956
Wait. She remembered my name.

429
00:29:43,781 --> 00:29:45,649
Welcome home.

430
00:29:56,502 --> 00:29:59,075
It's dark in there.

431
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,407
Your eyes will adjust.

432
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,577
It's better this way.

433
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:34,944
Dad.

434
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:44,621
This is not how I
imagined I would die.

435
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:47,711
Looking at my son

436
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,043
and seeing a stranger.

437
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,964
You have such potential, Harry.

438
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:58,730
Such fierce intelligence,

439
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,815
and you're throwing it all away.

440
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:03,218
No, you threw me away.

441
00:31:05,112 --> 00:31:08,641
You kicked me off to
boarding school when I was 11.

442
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:12,285
On my 16th birthday,

443
00:31:12,286 --> 00:31:14,245
you sent me Scotch.

444
00:31:14,246 --> 00:31:16,623
Or one of your assistants did.

445
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,823
I'm pretty sure
because the card read:

446
00:31:19,877 --> 00:31:24,422
“With compliments, Norman Osborn."

447
00:31:24,423 --> 00:31:27,300
I don't expect forgiveness from you

448
00:31:27,301 --> 00:31:29,169
anymore.

449
00:31:29,887 --> 00:31:32,847
I don't believe in miracles.

450
00:31:32,848 --> 00:31:35,809
How could you possibly understand

451
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,854
that your childhood
had to be sacrificed

452
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:42,007
for something greater?

453
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,681
And not just for me.

454
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,352
For you!

455
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,559
Has your hand
started to twitch yet?

456
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,106
When you lay awake
and you feel it coming,

457
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,159
hiding under your skin,

458
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:03,491
waiting to show itself.

459
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,922
To show you

460
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:09,092
who you really are.

461
00:32:12,596 --> 00:32:15,920
Retroviral hyperplasia.

462
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,216
I never told you...

463
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,473
that it's genetic.

464
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:27,140
Our disease,

465
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:30,473
the Osborn curse.

466
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,859
And it began at your age.

467
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:36,645
Let me see it.

468
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:40,736
Your hand. Give it to me.

469
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:52,211
The greatest inheritance
I can give you

470
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,179
isn't merely money.

471
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,581
It's this.

472
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:59,601
The sum total of all my work.

473
00:32:59,602 --> 00:33:03,973
Everything I did to stay alive.

474
00:33:03,981 --> 00:33:06,649
Maybe you can succeed

475
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,927
where I failed.

476
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:36,971
Norman Osborn, the legendary founder
and CEO of Oscorp Industries, has died,

477
00:33:36,972 --> 00:33:38,890
the Osborn estate has confirmed.

478
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,434
He is survived by his
only son, Harry Osborn

479
00:33:41,435 --> 00:33:44,521
who is the sole heir of the
Oscorp corporate empire.

480
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,980
Harry.

481
00:33:45,981 --> 00:33:49,601
Osborn changed the medical
profession's approach to human healing

482
00:33:49,735 --> 00:33:52,153
and affected
the lives of millions.

483
00:33:52,154 --> 00:33:56,783
I started Oscorp because I looked at
the world around me and I thought:

484
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,619
"We can do better.
And we should do better."

485
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:05,124
Einstein said, "The world cannot be
changed without changing our thinking."

486
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:08,028
But change isn't just a slogan.

487
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:10,004
It begins with hard work.

488
00:34:10,005 --> 00:34:13,830
Change begins with
persistence and commitment.

489
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:17,428
Mr. Osborn changed the world.

490
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:22,084
And now it's up to each of us to ensure
that his hopes and dreams remain alive.

491
00:34:22,142 --> 00:34:23,393
But not today.

492
00:34:24,603 --> 00:34:25,979
Today is for mourning.

493
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,356
- Hello?
- Is this Gwen Stacy?

494
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,732
Yes, it is. Who's calling?

495
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:33,778
I'm calling from the Oxford Scholars
Program. We have some exciting news.

496
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:41,160
- Whoa. Dillon. You stay here.
- What?

497
00:34:41,161 --> 00:34:44,122
There's a current flow problem in
the lab. Why don't you take a look?

498
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:47,151
It's my birthday. Everybody else
is leaving. Why do I have to stay?

499
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,544
- Because you're special.
- Smythe.

500
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,322
I mean, Mr. Smythe.

501
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,047
Happy birthday.

502
00:34:59,096 --> 00:35:03,296
The generation of electricity by
living organisms to fend off...

503
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,435
Let's see what's going
on with you. Hey, guys.

504
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,644
The genetically manipulated...

505
00:35:06,645 --> 00:35:08,922
At least somebody's partying.

506
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:11,759
All right. Just a little sick.

507
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,346
Mm-hm. I got your medicine, though.

508
00:35:15,904 --> 00:35:19,866
I'm so sick that I can't get to my birthday
after all I put together for this company.

509
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,159
Designed the grid...

510
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:23,953
- Warning:
- I should've stretched.

511
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:26,873
- Malfunction in Sector 5A.
- I know. Just a little indigestion.

512
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:29,626
I bet you didn't know it was
my birthday, huh, did you, Kari?

513
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,836
Think you can sing
“Happy Birthday" for me?

514
00:35:31,837 --> 00:35:34,205
I'll just have to sing it
for myself.

515
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,548
- Gilbert?
- What?

516
00:35:35,549 --> 00:35:39,302
It's Max. Can we shut down
power on Sector 32, please?

517
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,678
Forget it. I'm out the door.

518
00:35:40,679 --> 00:35:42,722
What do you mean?
I'm up here. It's dangerous.

519
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,466
- Sorry, Max.
- Hello?

520
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:50,298
Fine. I'll do it myself.
And sing my birthday song too.

521
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:52,231
This is crazy.

529
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:52,250
System restored.

530
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,028
Have a nice day.

531
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,837
Harry,

532
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,922
Oscorp's been under
intense public scrutiny

533
00:36:57,923 --> 00:37:00,341
in the wake of
Dr. Connors' recent, uh,

534
00:37:00,342 --> 00:37:01,676
breach of trust.

535
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,261
You mean people are pissed off

536
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,586
because he tried to turn everyone
in New York City into giant lizards.

537
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:09,934
Given that,

538
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:13,604
all the animal hybrid programs
he was involved in were destroyed

539
00:37:13,605 --> 00:37:16,107
to restore investor confidence.

540
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:19,944
Ah. That is the Osborn way.

541
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:23,865
Whatever's inconvenient around
here, just get rid of it, right?

542
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,691
Much of that scrutiny
may fall on you now.

543
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,913
We felt that plausible deniability
was your best option.

544
00:37:30,914 --> 00:37:33,066
Sure, sure. I get it.

545
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,501
Twenty-year-old kid.

546
00:37:35,502 --> 00:37:37,336
Two hundred billion dollar company.

547
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:39,330
What was Dad thinking?

548
00:37:39,965 --> 00:37:42,083
I mean, you're all lawyers, right?

549
00:37:43,802 --> 00:37:47,597
Surely, someone must've
questioned his sanity in the end.

550
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:50,975
Someone must've thought about having
him declared legally incompetent.

551
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,436
It would've made this
conversation a lot easier.

552
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,135
- Harry...
- It's Mr. Osborn.

553
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,514
We're not friends.

554
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,229
Hi.

555
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:12,990
You were his assistant, right?

556
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,450
Mm-hm.

557
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,952
What's your name?

558
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:19,712
Felicia.

559
00:38:19,713 --> 00:38:21,285
Felicia.

560
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,965
From now on,

561
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:27,166
everybody at this table
works for Felicia

562
00:38:27,262 --> 00:38:30,962
because Felicia works for me.

563
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,299
Would anybody like to speak up?

564
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:39,925
Well, good. Then you can all
keep yourjobs a little longer.

565
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:44,562
Sir, there's a Peter
Parker here to see you.

566
00:38:53,121 --> 00:38:55,990
Felicia, I wanna see
every file on this list.

567
00:38:57,251 --> 00:38:59,244
Every single one.

568
00:39:06,426 --> 00:39:08,294
Peter Parker.

569
00:39:09,137 --> 00:39:11,665
It's like seeing a ghost.

570
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,168
Hey, Harry.

571
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,218
Random.

572
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:19,048
- What, 10 years.
- It's eight.

573
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,641
But you're close.

574
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:23,973
What's up?

575
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:26,312
I saw the news, man.

576
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,615
I heard about your dad
and I wanted to come and...

577
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:34,021
Just wanted to come and see you.
Check to see how you were doing.

578
00:39:34,621 --> 00:39:36,773
I'm with some people.

579
00:39:39,626 --> 00:39:41,528
I'm in a...

580
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,170
I'm in a meeting.

581
00:39:43,171 --> 00:39:45,006
I'm sorry, I don't wanna intrude.

582
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,883
I know it's been a long time.

583
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,052
I kind of know exactly
what you're going through right now.

584
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:53,047
And you were so there for me
when my parents...

585
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:56,384
Well, that's why I'm here for you.

586
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,211
Thank you.

587
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,303
Ah, it's good to see you, man.

588
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:06,011
It's good to see you.

589
00:40:06,653 --> 00:40:08,805
I'm sorry about your dad.

590
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,936
You got your braces off.

591
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:21,125
Now there's nothing to
distract from your unibrow.

592
00:40:24,379 --> 00:40:26,201
There he is.

593
00:40:26,506 --> 00:40:28,925
- There he is.
- Ha-ha-ha.

594
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,052
You still blow-dry your
hair every morning?

595
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:36,015
Um... You know, one of my
manservants holds the hair dryer

596
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,059
- but I work the comb, okay?
- Ha-ha-ha.

597
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:42,313
So at least I'm not
completely helpless.

598
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:44,716
You're stupid.

599
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,449
After graduation, I went
to Brazil, then Singapore.

600
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,700
- That's right, yeah.
- Yeah.

601
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:56,744
And then Europe.
You know, I went to Europe.

602
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,271
I saw you.

603
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:00,289
What do you mean, you saw me?

604
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,667
I saw you in some magazine
with some French supermodel.

605
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,669
You know what I'm talking about?

606
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,587
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

607
00:41:06,588 --> 00:41:09,590
Dude, that whole model
thing is so exhausting.

608
00:41:09,591 --> 00:41:11,133
I know.

609
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,964
What? You got a lady?

610
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,593
Uh...

611
00:41:21,186 --> 00:41:23,304
That's a question.

612
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:25,690
That's a question.

613
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,343
- Unh.
- Whoa, buddy.

614
00:41:28,193 --> 00:41:29,936
No, I don't.

615
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,101
Yeah.

616
00:41:32,322 --> 00:41:34,565
I don't know. It's, uh...

617
00:41:37,452 --> 00:41:39,787
I don't know. It's complicated.

618
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,031
Yeah, I don't do complicated.

619
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:46,836
Uh, what's her name? Who is she?

620
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,337
Her name's Gwen.

621
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,285
Gwen Stacy.

622
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:53,634
- Gwen Stacy.
- She works for you.

623
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:55,344
Really? She works for me?

624
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,931
- She does work-study at Oscorp.
- Is she a model employee?

625
00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:03,102
You know, when my
father sent me away

626
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,382
I tried to forget
everything about this place.

627
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:10,803
I guess that kind of included you.

628
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,433
You ain't gotta explain
anything to me, man.

629
00:42:17,951 --> 00:42:19,728
We both got dumped.

630
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,734
You ever figure out
why your parents bailed?

631
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,493
My dad left a briefcase.

632
00:42:31,548 --> 00:42:34,341
That's all I got,
briefcase full of junk.

633
00:42:34,342 --> 00:42:36,927
Whatever. I don't know.
I try not to think about it.

634
00:42:36,928 --> 00:42:39,080
How's that working out for you?

635
00:42:39,347 --> 00:42:41,124
Perfectly.

636
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,508
Dude. Nice arm.

637
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:52,359
It's just the wrist. It's just all
in the wrist, buddy.

638
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,737
You could do it too if you
just strengthened up that.

639
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:56,355
Yeah, right.

640
00:42:56,490 --> 00:43:00,110
You gotta admit, though. Things
have gotten crazy around here, man.

641
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:02,445
Giant lizards

642
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:04,944
and spider guys.

643
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,710
Just one guy. Just one spider man.

644
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:13,411
Or woman. We don't know for sure.

645
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:17,745
Whatever, dude. He wears spandex
to rescue kittens from trees.

646
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,929
I'm so impressed.

647
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,424
I kind of like to think
he gives people hope.

648
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:24,141
For what?

649
00:43:24,142 --> 00:43:27,103
Maybe eventually
everything's gonna be all right.

650
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:29,730
Yeah, I just wish I had time
for "eventually."

651
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,069
Who was he?

652
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,223
Maxwell Dillon.
Electrical engineer.

653
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:41,117
No associates or friends
to speak of.

654
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:44,662
He submitted specs for the grid
that we appropriated.

655
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:46,189
The guy was

656
00:43:46,456 --> 00:43:48,153
invisible.

657
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:52,992
Wall Street's nervous enough
with that child, Harry, taking over.

658
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:55,240
We've gotta find a way
to get him out.

659
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,509
In the meantime, if the press
gets hold of this accident,

660
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,969
our stock will crater.

661
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,216
So make sure this Mr. Dillon
stays invisible.

662
00:44:05,725 --> 00:44:08,844
This could prove useful for us
in the future.

663
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:17,071

Okay, great, great. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. All right.

Well, I mean...

690
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:52,933
Ha, ha. If we're gonna be friends, I think
we gotta establish some ground rules.

691
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:55,102
- Some ground rules?
- Yeah, some ground rules.

692
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,062
- Heh, heh. Heh.
- Like that.

693
00:46:57,063 --> 00:46:58,680
Like what?

694
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,026
- That laugh. That laugh.
- What?

695
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,819
That's off the table.

696
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,863
- My laugh is off the table?
- Off the table.

697
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:08,157
You gotta figure out
a more annoying laugh.

698
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,650
That's still adorable.

699
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,247
- That was not adorable.
- It's adorable.

700
00:47:15,248 --> 00:47:16,707
No, it's not adorable.

701
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,626
- Okay. I have a ground rule. Um...
- Oh, good.

702
00:47:19,627 --> 00:47:21,420
- What is it?
- Uh...

703
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:24,165
Don't tell me that I look amazing

704
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:28,457
with your big brown doe eyes. Okay?

705
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,506
I'm really serious about that one.

706
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,558
- Oh, no.
- What?

707
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,643
I just figured out
the next ground rule.

708
00:47:36,644 --> 00:47:38,020
What?

709
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,772
No more of this.

710
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,024
No more of this little
nose rub that you do.

711
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:43,817
- This?
- Don't think I haven't... Hey.

712
00:47:43,818 --> 00:47:46,779
What am I supposed to do?
It's allergy season.

713
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,447
This is killing me.

714
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:51,200
You're just spitting in the face
of my ground rules. I'm out.

715
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,853
Come on. Heh.

716
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,860
First we get ice cream,
and then I'm out.

717
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,787
Um, yeah. So I did that.

718
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:41,917
And I got completely addicted to
this place that has Korean meatballs.

719
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:44,837
- Yeah. No, I know.
- Have you been there? It's mind-blowing.

720
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,464
That place on 6th. I know.
You love it there.

721
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,086
How do you know that?

722
00:48:53,638 --> 00:48:56,962
- Hm?
- How do you know I love it there?

723
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,926
Because, um...

724
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,801
Because you told me.

725
00:49:05,733 --> 00:49:08,101
It just opened last month.

726
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:13,683
Have you been following me?

727
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,524
I knew it.

728
00:49:20,748 --> 00:49:22,400
How often?

729
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,337
Just once a day.

730
00:49:27,338 --> 00:49:29,081
Sometimes.

731
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:33,165
Sometimes more.

732
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,266
Oh, boy.

733
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,793
Why?

734
00:49:44,939 --> 00:49:46,886
Make sure I'm safe?

735
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:49,443
- And...
- And what?

736
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:53,269
And because it's the closest
I can get to still being with you.

737
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:07,616
I'm moving to England.

738
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,246
What?

739
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:19,207
Yeah. Um...

740
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:23,254
I have a... I'm up for a
scholarship to Oxford.

741
00:50:24,062 --> 00:50:27,356
In molecular medicine. And it's
between me and this other kid.

742
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:29,483
There's this oral exam
that we have to do

743
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:32,486
and he's, like, a freshman
in college, but he's 14.

744
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,613
And... And it's... it could be him.

745
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,657
But it might be me. I hope it's me.

746
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:40,358
And I'm thinking that
I'll be moving to England.

747
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,572
- Wow.
- Yeah.

748
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:45,574
And I'm really excited.

749
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,323
That's, uh...

750
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,911
England.

751
00:50:55,426 --> 00:50:57,078
What?

752
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,360
Station, I need a 10-85.

753
00:51:55,361 --> 00:51:58,780
Send out additional units to the
south-end corner of Duffy Square.

754
00:51:58,781 --> 00:52:00,741
Folks, could you step to the side?

755
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:03,270
Everybody get out of the
way! Get out of the way!

756
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,148
Sir, get your hands away
from the cables right now!

757
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:10,167
Sir, get your hands
away from the cables!

758
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:12,536
Let me see your hands, please!

759
00:52:13,963 --> 00:52:15,422
You stay right where you are!

760
00:52:15,423 --> 00:52:16,882
Do not move!

761
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,411
Freeze! Get down! On the ground!

762
00:52:36,778 --> 00:52:38,779
Get down on the ground, now!

763
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,030
Stop!

764
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,698
Get your ass down on
the ground! Now!

765
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:43,617
- It's not my fault!
- Sir!

766
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,202
- Stop!
- I'm gonna need for you

767
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:47,162
- Please!
- To get down on the ground, now!

768
00:52:47,163 --> 00:52:50,582
For your own safety and the safety
of the other patrons in this area.

769
00:52:52,835 --> 00:52:54,657
Oh, my gosh.

770
00:52:55,713 --> 00:52:58,707
They see me. You see me.

771
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,211
You see me.

772
00:53:02,428 --> 00:53:04,296
They see me.

773
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,193
- No! No! Stop!
- On the ground now!

774
00:53:18,194 --> 00:53:21,071
- Don't do that. Please!
- It's over, freak!

775
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:23,657
Wait! It's not my fault.

776
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,825
It's not my fault!

777
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:29,401
I said stop!

778
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:38,119
I'm glad you're not one of
those cops that rides a horse.

779
00:53:45,012 --> 00:53:47,756
All team members, hold your
fire and wait for my call.

780
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:54,714
All units, hold your fire! I repeat,
hold your fire! Stand down!

781
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,608
Stop. Stop it.

782
00:53:58,609 --> 00:54:00,135
Yo, Sparkles!

783
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:03,059
Hey, how you doing?

784
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,408
- It's you?
- Yeah, I know it's me.

785
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,685
Who are you?

786
00:54:09,203 --> 00:54:10,729
You don't remember me?

787
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,111
No. Should I?

788
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:17,002
I walked into the street. The car
almost hit me. You swooped me up.

789
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,670
You saved me.

790
00:54:18,671 --> 00:54:20,589
You said you needed me.

791
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:23,664
- You're the guy with the blueprints.
- Yes.

792
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,119
Blueprints.

793
00:54:25,136 --> 00:54:30,098
Yes, I remember you. Of course I
remember you. You're my eyes and ears.

794
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:33,143
- Uh, what's your name again?
- How could you forget me?

795
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,812
- I do, I know it, I know it, don't tell me.
- It's Max.

796
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:37,856
- Is it "Max"?
- Yes.

797
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,180
I'm sorry I didn't
recognize you with the...

798
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:41,943
You look different.

799
00:54:41,944 --> 00:54:43,779
How are you?

800
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,822
I don't know what's
going on with me.

801
00:54:45,823 --> 00:54:48,191
I can see that. I can...
I believe you.

802
00:54:48,826 --> 00:54:53,732
It's strange, the power
I feel. I got so much...

803
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:55,749
I got so much anger.

804
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:58,752
I can see that. I can see you don't
wanna be here and you're scared.

805
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,754
I see you don't know
what's happening to you.

806
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:02,907
I can see you don't want to
hurt anybody.

807
00:55:03,132 --> 00:55:05,592
- It's gonna be all right.
- Got a clear shot. Standing by.

808
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,761
- I don't want them shooting me anymore.
- They won't.

809
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:10,514
You guys. This is my buddy, Max.

810
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,100
I told you about Max.
No one shoots at Max!

811
00:55:14,101 --> 00:55:16,603
You and me, okay? It's just you
and me talking. Whoa, whoa.

812
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:20,232
Stay right there. Just be careful.
The grate, because of the electricity.

813
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,634
I just...

814
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,111
I just wanted everyone to see me.

815
00:55:25,112 --> 00:55:27,280
He makes a move, take that shot.

816
00:55:27,281 --> 00:55:29,449
How about you come with me?
We'll go talk.

817
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:31,493
Away from all these people, okay?

818
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,861
Yeah, yes.

819
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:35,455

York 1's Jessica Abo at the scene.

857
01:00:14,693 --> 01:00:17,260
That's right. We're standing
here with two eyewitnesses

858
01:00:17,286 --> 01:00:19,322
who are going to tell
us what they just saw.

859
01:00:19,323 --> 01:00:21,533
Tell us, how do you think
Spider-Man did it?

860
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,118
How do you think
he beat this creature?

861
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:26,955
Yeah, it's gotta be rubberized, Spidey's suit.
That's why he didn't get electrocuted.

862
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:29,499
Probably some kind of neoprene.
That's what I'd use.

863
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,251
Thank you very much
to the two of you.

Online polls show a sudden uptick

902
01:02:29,954 --> 01:02:32,580
in public sentiment in
favor of the web-crawler.

903
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:36,626
Tonight, it would seem New York City
owes him a debt of gratitude.

904
01:03:07,616 --> 01:03:10,285
Next-generation military body armor.

905
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:14,539
Features include enhanced mobility,
battlefield injury repair,

906
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:17,238
direct nervous system interface.

907
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:28,303
So the common household spider,

908
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,887
um, unlike human cells,

909
01:03:29,888 --> 01:03:32,724
theirs contain the
power to self-heal

910
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:36,519
from severe infection,
tissue damage, et cetera.

911
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:41,517
We've used a radioactive isotope
with compatible human DNA.

912
01:03:42,234 --> 01:03:46,487
Welcome to Dr. Jallings,
Science Investigator.

913
01:03:46,488 --> 01:03:49,574
Today we're going to be
talking about electricity.

914
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:52,869
Batteries, insulators,
electromagnetic currents.

915
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:55,621
Batteries can withstand
a lot of incoming charges.

916
01:03:55,622 --> 01:03:59,042
The more powerful the battery,
the bigger the charge it can withstand.

917
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:03,046
But if the incoming charge
exceeds the outgoing charge

918
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,965
- the battery might explode!
- Ouch!

919
01:04:05,966 --> 01:04:07,618
Explode!

920
01:04:07,968 --> 01:04:09,164
Boom!

921
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:13,139
When doing experiments like this,
always wear protective gear.

922
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:14,515
You're not invincible.

923
01:04:14,516 --> 01:04:16,642
We're gonna need a bigger battery.

924
01:04:57,851 --> 01:04:59,719
- Hello.
- Pete.

925
01:04:59,895 --> 01:05:01,562
It's me.

926
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:03,556
Hey, Harry. What...?

927
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,347
What time is it?

928
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:10,390
Uh, late, early, I don't know.
I've been up all night.

929
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,948
I need to see you.

930
01:05:11,949 --> 01:05:13,408
You all right?

931
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:15,186
Not really, Pete.

932
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:16,744
I'm dying.

933
01:05:16,745 --> 01:05:19,898
But I think you can help
save my life.

934
01:05:20,999 --> 01:05:25,336
You're looking at the world's
first human-spider hybrids.

935
01:05:25,337 --> 01:05:28,464
The hope is to extract the
venom from their glands

936
01:05:28,465 --> 01:05:31,134
and turn that into a cure.

937
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,970
An agent that heals diseased cells.

938
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:39,350
And if I can be cured, imagine what
this could do for other diseases

939
01:05:39,351 --> 01:05:41,845
like Alzheimer's, even cancer.

940
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:48,359
They never made it to human trials.

941
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:52,390
It's 14 years of research,
and nothing to show for it.

942
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:56,859
Except maybe this.

943
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:06,487
Spider-Man.

944
01:06:07,087 --> 01:06:08,739
What about him?

945
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:12,410
He was bitten by one of
those things, and it worked.

946
01:06:12,634 --> 01:06:16,664
I don't know how
and I don't know why,

947
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,391
but he can do everything
else a spider can,

948
01:06:20,392 --> 01:06:22,894
including self-heal.

949
01:06:22,895 --> 01:06:24,888
I need to find him.

950
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:27,265
I need his blood.

951
01:06:42,372 --> 01:06:44,149
You need...

952
01:06:44,791 --> 01:06:47,410
Spider-Man's blood?

953
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:53,037
It'll save my life.

954
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:55,377
It may not, Har.

955
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,803
It may not be that simple.

956
01:06:57,804 --> 01:06:59,805
You saw what happened
to Curt Connors, right?

957
01:06:59,806 --> 01:07:01,207
Connors was weak.

958
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:03,559
This is me, Peter.

959
01:07:03,560 --> 01:07:06,054
I don't think you can
just set up a van

960
01:07:06,688 --> 01:07:08,064
and have him donate.

961
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:13,528
I mean, I'm sure he's sensitive
about people shoving needles and...

962
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:15,055
Ah, he's sensitive, okay.

963
01:07:15,155 --> 01:07:20,159
Well, then, maybe you could just
sensitively tell me where he is,

964
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,858
and I will go ask him myself.

965
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,356
What?

966
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,368
- You took his picture.
- So?

967
01:07:29,586 --> 01:07:31,462
- You know him.
- Harry.

968
01:07:31,463 --> 01:07:35,007
I took a picture from a long
way away. I used a long lens.

969
01:07:35,008 --> 01:07:36,625
I don't know him.

970
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:41,423
I put together what
you said at the river.

971
01:07:42,307 --> 01:07:45,711
- What I...
- About how he gives people hope.

972
01:07:47,437 --> 01:07:49,134
Come on.

973
01:08:02,494 --> 01:08:03,941
What in the...?

974
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,447
Just say yes.

975
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:19,286
Don't turn your back on me!

976
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:23,085
I don't wanna end up
like my father, Peter.

977
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:26,213
Please.

978
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,270
Peter, please.

979
01:08:29,271 --> 01:08:31,048
I can't.

980
01:08:34,651 --> 01:08:36,098
Please.

981
01:08:40,532 --> 01:08:42,605
I'm gonna try

982
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:45,111
and find Spider-Man.

983
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:56,756
Hey, what's security
doing over here?

984
01:08:56,757 --> 01:08:58,007
That's so weird.

985
01:08:58,008 --> 01:08:59,284
She's right over there.

986
01:09:06,308 --> 01:09:08,176
Hey! Miss Stacy!

987
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:25,284
Hi.

988
01:09:25,285 --> 01:09:26,869
Hi.

989
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,567
What are you doing here?

990
01:09:28,705 --> 01:09:30,732
- What are you doing here?
- Oh...

991
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:33,697
Come here.

992
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,176
She's not here.
Check another floor.

993
01:09:42,177 --> 01:09:43,969
- Got it.
- Yes, sir!

994
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:45,262
You're in trouble.

995
01:09:45,263 --> 01:09:46,681
- Yeah.
- Who's that guy?

996
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,684
There was an accident in the genomics
lab, and they're covering it up.

997
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,187
And I found out. That guy
from Times Square last night?

998
01:09:53,188 --> 01:09:56,607
I met him. He was an electrical
engineer in the building.

999
01:09:56,608 --> 01:09:59,819
And he loved Spider-Man, by
the way. He was, like, a fanatic.

1000
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:03,698
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a
"want to kill me with his electricity" vibe.

1001
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,147
That's actually kind of
what it's like to love you.

1002
01:10:06,952 --> 01:10:10,287
I was searching for him in the computer
and all the files, he's erased.

1003
01:10:10,288 --> 01:10:11,789
- My God.
- He's completely erased.

1004
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:13,207
That's Oscorp.

1005
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,418
And what about you?
Why are you here?

1006
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:16,669
Harry.

1007
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:18,538
- Osborn?
- He's dying.

1008
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,172
- What do you mean?
- He's dying.

1009
01:10:20,173 --> 01:10:22,967
And he thinks the only thing
that's gonna save his life

1010
01:10:22,968 --> 01:10:25,761
is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood.

1011
01:10:25,762 --> 01:10:28,472
And as far as I know, if I
give it to him, it could kill him.

1012
01:10:28,473 --> 01:10:30,671
Or something worse.

1013
01:10:30,934 --> 01:10:32,309
I know.

1014
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:35,179
This is the maintenance
closet, Gwen.

1015
01:10:35,313 --> 01:10:38,441
This is the most clichéd
hiding place you could've chosen.

1016
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,651
- This is the stupidest hiding place.
- I'm sorry,

1017
01:10:40,652 --> 01:10:44,864
I didn't take us to the
Bahamas of hiding places.

1018
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:49,020
I gotta talk to you about England,
I guess, because I don't...

1019
01:10:58,336 --> 01:11:01,831
- You just kissed me.
- I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

1020
01:11:02,382 --> 01:11:03,874
How'd you like it?

1021
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:05,551
It felt a little bit rushed.

1022
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:08,080
I know. I know, I know.

1023
01:11:08,263 --> 01:11:11,932
This is the plan. You get to the elevator.
I'm gonna distract him, okay?

1024
01:11:11,933 --> 01:11:13,058
Okay.

1025
01:11:27,699 --> 01:11:29,742
- Ooh! God! Damn it!
- I'm so...

1026
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:33,204
I just spilled a hot latte all over your...
I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no!

1027
01:11:33,205 --> 01:11:35,289
And you too? I'm sorry.

1028
01:11:35,290 --> 01:11:37,041
- Miss! Stay right there!
- Sir.

1029
01:11:37,042 --> 01:11:39,543
- Just stay right...
- Wait, wait, wait.

1030
01:11:39,544 --> 01:11:40,945
Hey! Stop!

1031
01:11:43,006 --> 01:11:44,256
- All right. On your way.
- Aah.

1032
01:11:44,257 --> 01:11:46,910
I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.

1033
01:11:51,348 --> 01:11:53,876
- Gwen Stacy. Ha, ha.
- Oh, my God.

1034
01:11:54,434 --> 01:11:55,976
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1035
01:11:55,977 --> 01:11:57,720
No, it's okay.

1036
01:11:58,146 --> 01:12:00,890
Uh, I'm... I'm Harry.

1037
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:02,592
Yeah.

1038
01:12:02,901 --> 01:12:06,821
- I'm an old friend of Peter's.
- Yeah, I know who you are. Sorry.

1039
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:08,697
I was kind of rushing.

1040
01:12:08,698 --> 01:12:11,367
No, I'm sorry he
never introduced us.

1041
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,862
I thought you two had broken up.

1042
01:12:14,204 --> 01:12:15,730
Oh.

1043
01:12:16,248 --> 01:12:18,916
Yeah. Yes, we had.

1044
01:12:18,917 --> 01:12:20,709
And it's...

1045
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:22,837
- It's complicated.
- Complicated. Yeah.

1046
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,298
I mean, it's Peter. Heh. Everything's
always complicated with Peter.

1047
01:12:26,299 --> 01:12:27,700
Yeah.

1048
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:29,495
Yeah.

1049
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:31,671
Yeah, you're right.

1050
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:33,806
But that's why he needs you.

1051
01:12:35,267 --> 01:12:36,839
Right?

1052
01:12:38,603 --> 01:12:41,506
To help him make his choices clear.

1053
01:12:44,943 --> 01:12:46,193
Nice to meet you, Harry.

1054
01:12:46,194 --> 01:12:49,598
Yeah, it's such a pleasure, Gwen.

1055
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:48,540
You've been in a terrible accident.

1056
01:13:49,424 --> 01:13:51,792
I'm Dr. Kafka.

1057
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:54,345
I'm here to help you.

1058
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,339
Course you are, doc.

1059
01:13:56,973 --> 01:14:01,469
That's why you're preparing
military-grade biostim electrodes.

1060
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,047
High-intensity capacitors.

1061
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,508
The kind they make at Oscorp.

1062
01:14:06,691 --> 01:14:09,526
All of this because you're
trying to help me.

1063
01:14:09,527 --> 01:14:11,070
You are correct.

1064
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,280
I'm here to study you.

1065
01:14:13,281 --> 01:14:18,202
To understand what you are,
why you are.

1066
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,480
Und I will get results.

1067
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,919
I always do.

1068
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:31,874
You do realize

1069
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:34,290
you locked me in a prison

1070
01:14:34,427 --> 01:14:36,124
that runs

1071
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:38,138
on electricity?

1072
01:14:40,141 --> 01:14:43,227
Mm. I can feel it in the walls.

1073
01:14:43,228 --> 01:14:45,505
I can feel it in my veins.

1074
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:49,055
No matter what you do,
doc, you can't contain it.

1075
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:51,643
It's a force of nature.

1076
01:14:52,904 --> 01:14:54,305
Like me.

1077
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,247
You wanna know how powerful I am?

1078
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:05,624
Well, so do I.

1079
01:15:05,625 --> 01:15:06,917
Ooh!

1080
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,575
I'm dying to know,

1081
01:15:13,883 --> 01:15:15,409
doc.

1082
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:19,013
But you better make damn
sure you kill me this time.

1083
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,916
Because if you don't,

1084
01:15:21,141 --> 01:15:23,559
I'm gonna kill the light.

1085
01:15:23,560 --> 01:15:28,306
So everyone in this city is gonna know
how it feels to live in my world.

1086
01:15:28,398 --> 01:15:30,858
A world without power.

1087
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:33,637
A world without mercy.

1088
01:15:33,653 --> 01:15:35,279
A world

1089
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:37,307
without Spider-Man.

1090
01:15:37,407 --> 01:15:42,108
And everyone will be able to
see me for who I truly am.

1091
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:44,772
And who are you?

1092
01:15:44,914 --> 01:15:46,782
Don't you know?

1093
01:15:47,042 --> 01:15:48,659
I'm Electro.

1094
01:15:53,631 --> 01:15:57,051
Warning: Electrical
restraint capacity reached.

1095
01:15:57,052 --> 01:16:00,054
Initiate lockdown procedure
immediately.

1096
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,082
Very impressive,

1097
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,713
Electro.

1098
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,337
Lockdown initiated.

1099
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:19,948
Aunt May?

1100
01:16:19,949 --> 01:16:21,566
Aunt May?

1101
01:16:26,623 --> 01:16:28,320
What are you doing?

1102
01:16:28,374 --> 01:16:30,196
When did you do this?

1103
01:16:39,302 --> 01:16:42,179
There's something
you're not telling me, Aunt May.

1104
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,584
Every time I mention my parents,
your eyes go down.

1105
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,977
I know you're not telling me something.
You lie to me. I know you love me.

1106
01:16:48,978 --> 01:16:51,063
- I don't lie.
- I know you love me, but you do.

1107
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:52,841
Aunt May, Aunt May.

1108
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,639
You have to tell me, May.

1109
01:16:56,236 --> 01:16:57,694
That's my father.

1110
01:16:57,695 --> 01:16:59,363
Yes, he was your father.

1111
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:02,392
But that didn't seem to
stop him from leaving you...

1112
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:04,272
here.

1113
01:17:05,537 --> 01:17:07,405
I need the truth.

1114
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:12,042
The truth is, your parents
left you here, on our doorstep.

1115
01:17:12,043 --> 01:17:14,044
You were this little boy
whose whole world

1116
01:17:14,045 --> 01:17:17,005
was turned upside down
with no explanation.

1117
01:17:17,006 --> 01:17:22,162
We did the best we could,
your Uncle Ben and I.

1118
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,848
I mean, who else was gonna care for you,
and protect you and worry about you?

1119
01:17:25,849 --> 01:17:27,432
Your father?

1120
01:17:27,433 --> 01:17:28,767
No.

1121
01:17:28,768 --> 01:17:33,147
I was the one who wiped your nose,
and made you brush your teeth,

1122
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:36,191
and do your homework,
or washed your dirty underwear. Me!

1123
01:17:36,192 --> 01:17:41,029
Your stupid, non-scientific aunt, who
doesn't know how to make ends meet,

1124
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:42,906
who has to take nursing classes

1125
01:17:42,907 --> 01:17:46,034
with 22-year-old kids so I can
pay for you to go to college.

1126
01:17:46,035 --> 01:17:48,370
And I don't know how
to do this without Ben.

1127
01:17:48,371 --> 01:17:49,897
I don't know how. And...

1128
01:17:50,290 --> 01:17:53,709
And you're dreaming about
your perfect father,

1129
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:56,784
who was never here. No.

1130
01:17:57,547 --> 01:17:59,381
No, I won't tell you.

1131
01:17:59,382 --> 01:18:00,716
You're my boy.

1132
01:18:00,717 --> 01:18:03,302
As far as I'm concerned,
you're my boy.

1133
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:04,795
And I won't hurt you.

1134
01:18:14,022 --> 01:18:16,140
I'm your boy.

1135
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:18,138
You're my everything.

1136
01:18:19,068 --> 01:18:22,696
You're enough.
You're more than enough.

1137
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:25,520
That's not what this is about.
Don't get that twisted.

1138
01:18:26,242 --> 01:18:29,395
- I love you so much.
- I know.

1139
01:18:33,875 --> 01:18:35,618
It's okay.

1140
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:38,078
It's okay.

1141
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:42,204
May.

1142
01:18:44,928 --> 01:18:47,501
I need to know.

1143
01:18:51,726 --> 01:18:53,343
All right.

1144
01:18:56,564 --> 01:18:58,807
I'll tell you everything I know.

1145
01:19:01,402 --> 01:19:03,270
But it will hurt you.

1146
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:05,473
Okay.

1147
01:19:07,784 --> 01:19:10,452
A few days after the funeral,

1148
01:19:10,453 --> 01:19:14,608
two government men came to see us.

1149
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:19,419
They said the genetics research

1150
01:19:19,420 --> 01:19:23,131
that your father was doing with
Norman Osborn was very valuable,

1151
01:19:23,132 --> 01:19:26,009
and that people
would pay a lot for it.

1152
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:28,262
And that's why he ran off with it.

1153
01:19:28,263 --> 01:19:30,222
They said he was a traitor.

1154
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:32,307
I couldn't believe it, Peter.

1155
01:19:32,308 --> 01:19:35,519
They told us he betrayed
his best friend, all of us,

1156
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:37,263
for the money.

1157
01:19:38,147 --> 01:19:39,639
I don't...

1158
01:19:41,776 --> 01:19:44,319
Oh, I don't get it. No, I don't...
This doesn't make sense.

1159
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:48,198
Yes, I know. I know. I didn't
believe it either. I didn't believe it.

1160
01:19:48,199 --> 01:19:49,700
It doesn't make any sense.

1161
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:51,318
Peter, I don't know.

1162
01:19:51,327 --> 01:19:54,621
For so long, I would play it over
and over and over in my head.

1163
01:19:54,622 --> 01:19:57,124
What had I missed?
What had I missed?

1164
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,876
He was just this
normal, unassuming guy.

1165
01:19:59,877 --> 01:20:03,213
He wore the same ratty
lab coat for 20 years.

1166
01:20:03,214 --> 01:20:06,133
He took the D train to
work at 7 every morning.

1167
01:20:06,134 --> 01:20:08,707
Came home at 6 every night.

1168
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,289
I don't know.

1169
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:15,085
Maybe everyone has
a part of themselves they hide.

1170
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:18,630
Even from the people they love.

1171
01:20:24,527 --> 01:20:26,019
Peter.

1172
01:20:28,906 --> 01:20:30,558
Peter.

1173
01:20:34,203 --> 01:20:36,105
Mr. Osborn.

1174
01:20:40,668 --> 01:20:42,285
Look up.

1175
01:20:43,087 --> 01:20:45,034
Think you're looking for me.

1176
01:20:47,383 --> 01:20:49,956
I cannot believe my eyes.

1177
01:20:51,304 --> 01:20:53,001
Spider-Man.

1178
01:20:59,896 --> 01:21:02,298
Just the man I wanted to see.

1179
01:21:04,692 --> 01:21:06,435
You, um...

1180
01:21:07,528 --> 01:21:09,350
talked to Peter?

1181
01:21:09,864 --> 01:21:11,311
Yeah.

1182
01:21:16,287 --> 01:21:20,612
I wanna help you, Mr.
Osborn. I really, really do.

1183
01:21:21,292 --> 01:21:25,170
I can't give you my blood.
Not right now.

1184
01:21:25,171 --> 01:21:26,697
Excuse me?

1185
01:21:27,256 --> 01:21:29,408
It's too dangerous.

1186
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:32,662
If our blood is incompatible,
you could die.

1187
01:21:33,721 --> 01:21:35,919
I'm already dying.

1188
01:21:36,849 --> 01:21:39,518
Your blood can't make me die more.

1189
01:21:39,519 --> 01:21:41,520
But it could do something worse.

1190
01:21:44,023 --> 01:21:45,595
Okay.

1191
01:21:46,901 --> 01:21:48,819
All right, how much?

1192
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,363
- How much what?
- How much do you want? Name it.

1193
01:21:51,364 --> 01:21:55,575
You want a boat? You want a plane? You
want money? How much do you want?

1194
01:21:55,576 --> 01:21:59,230
- I don't want your money.
- Come on. Everybody wants my money!

1195
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:01,065
I don't.

1196
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:04,781
I thought you...

1197
01:22:05,211 --> 01:22:07,955
I thought you were
supposed to save people.

1198
01:22:08,589 --> 01:22:12,509
I thought that's what you do,
is you save people's lives.

1199
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:15,053
You're... You're just gonna
let me die.

1200
01:22:15,054 --> 01:22:18,515
- I'm trying to protect you right now.
- No. No, you are not.

1201
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:21,339
You're trying to protect yourself.

1202
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:25,981
Look, we just need a bit more time

1203
01:22:25,982 --> 01:22:28,062
- to figure out something else.
- I do not have time!

1204
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:36,983
I'm sorry.

1205
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:49,489
You're a fraud, Spider-Man! Unh!

1206
01:23:02,685 --> 01:23:04,686
- Unh! Hey! Hi.
- Hi.

1207
01:23:04,687 --> 01:23:07,856
- Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second.
- I'm running late right now.

1208
01:23:07,857 --> 01:23:10,692
- It's just gonna take a second.
- I can't. I'm sorry, Peter.

1209
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:14,237
Just give me one minute. I just
wanna say one thing and I'm gone.

1210
01:23:14,238 --> 01:23:16,448
- Everything's a mess. Everything's insane.
- Shh. Shh.

1211
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,909
My dad, my mom. Everything
I thought about them? Lies.

1212
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:22,078
Ha! Lies. Lies, lies, lies. Nothing
makes any sense anymore.

1213
01:23:22,079 --> 01:23:24,164
I gotta figure out what
I'm gonna do with Harry.

1214
01:23:24,165 --> 01:23:25,874
Of course I wanna
save him. You know?

1215
01:23:25,875 --> 01:23:27,751
I wanna save him
because he's my best pal.

1216
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:30,837
And what if my blood works?
But what if it doesn't?

1217
01:23:30,838 --> 01:23:32,547
I don't know. I got no idea.

1218
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:37,093
- Oh, God.
- I got nothing. I got nothing.

1219
01:23:37,094 --> 01:23:40,055
The only thing I keep
coming back to, Gwen, is...

1220
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,046
Ms. Stacy?

1221
01:23:43,267 --> 01:23:44,684
Shall I take you upstairs?

1222
01:23:44,685 --> 01:23:47,312
Yes. I'm so sorry.

1223
01:23:47,313 --> 01:23:51,733
I'm so sorry. I'm already late.
Can I have just one more minute?

1224
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:53,932
- Okay.
- Thank you. I'm sorry.

1225
01:23:54,987 --> 01:23:57,197
- I'm... Ahem. Okay. I have to be...
- Where are we?

1226
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,975
I'm at my...

1227
01:23:59,325 --> 01:24:02,399
last interview for
Oxford right now.

1228
01:24:03,454 --> 01:24:05,580
- Oxford. I didn't know.
- Yeah.

1229
01:24:05,581 --> 01:24:08,041
Oh. Okay, well...

1230
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:10,794
I'm sorry to bother you, uh,

1231
01:24:10,795 --> 01:24:12,629
my fair lady... Madam.

1232
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:14,631
But who am I?

1233
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,424
I mean, who am I?
I'm John Hopkins.

1234
01:24:16,425 --> 01:24:18,718
I'm one of the young
professors at Harvard,

1235
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:22,089
and I've been trying to
get her to be in my...

1236
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:24,891
Be a part of my team
for a while now.

1237
01:24:24,892 --> 01:24:28,061
And she's just the best person
I know and a scientific genius.

1238
01:24:28,062 --> 01:24:29,312
And...

1239
01:24:29,313 --> 01:24:30,981
Anyway, God save the queen.

1240
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:33,024
- I'm sorry everything's happening...
- Can you wait?

1241
01:24:33,025 --> 01:24:34,776
Peter. Peter.

1242
01:24:34,777 --> 01:24:36,770
What do you want to say to me?

1243
01:24:37,196 --> 01:24:39,064
What's the "one thing"?

1244
01:24:42,743 --> 01:24:44,986
I have to go to England, Peter.

1245
01:24:46,581 --> 01:24:48,358
It's important to me.

1246
01:24:52,336 --> 01:24:56,366
I mean, I don't know. Maybe
we're on different paths right now.

1247
01:24:56,632 --> 01:24:58,967
You know? I don't know.

1248
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:00,711
Maybe we're just

1249
01:25:00,845 --> 01:25:02,596
going different ways. I don't...

1250
01:25:02,597 --> 01:25:05,091
I've gotta go. I gotta go.

1251
01:25:08,102 --> 01:25:09,219
Gwen.

1252
01:25:11,939 --> 01:25:13,511
Good luck.

1253
01:25:16,652 --> 01:25:19,154
Hi. Sorry.

1254
01:26:19,131 --> 01:26:22,876
He took the D train every
morning at 7 to work.

1255
01:26:22,968 --> 01:26:25,917
Came home at 6:00 every evening.

1256
01:26:33,145 --> 01:26:35,271
"Roosevelt's secret station.

1257
01:26:35,272 --> 01:26:37,899
Track 61, a secret
subterranean extension

1258
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:40,860
of New York's D Line train
under Pershing Square

1259
01:26:40,861 --> 01:26:44,739
built to transport President Franklin
Roosevelt away from the public eye,

1260
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:48,565
to keep his polio hidden
from the American people."

1261
01:26:58,337 --> 01:27:00,034
Mr. Osborn?

1262
01:27:01,465 --> 01:27:02,757
You all right?

1263
01:27:02,758 --> 01:27:05,510
Is there anything I can get you?

1264
01:27:05,511 --> 01:27:08,915
No, not unless you can bring
those spiders back to life.

1265
01:27:09,181 --> 01:27:10,473
Spiders?

1266
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:12,842
The ones that they destroyed...

1267
01:27:13,602 --> 01:27:17,176
"to restore investor confidence."

1268
01:27:18,190 --> 01:27:20,233
Go home, Felicia.

1269
01:27:20,234 --> 01:27:21,931
Take the day off.

1270
01:27:23,821 --> 01:27:25,313
Harry.

1271
01:27:27,032 --> 01:27:31,232
I think there may be another way
to get what you're looking for.

1272
01:27:33,122 --> 01:27:37,868
I overheard Menken talking
with one of our security heads.

1273
01:27:38,544 --> 01:27:40,742
Before they destroyed the spiders,

1274
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:43,324
they had the venom extracted.

1275
01:27:43,924 --> 01:27:47,123
Uh, what?

1276
01:27:49,013 --> 01:27:50,680
What are you saying?

1277
01:27:50,681 --> 01:27:52,766
That way, they could
comply with the lawsuits,

1278
01:27:52,767 --> 01:27:56,011
but still keep the data in
case it ever became useful.

1279
01:27:56,979 --> 01:27:58,354
Where is it?

1280
01:27:58,355 --> 01:28:00,553
It's somewhere in the building.

1281
01:28:01,650 --> 01:28:05,487
It's somewhere off-books
called "Special Projects."

1282
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,282
Special Projects.

1283
01:28:09,283 --> 01:28:10,950
Most recent entry:

1284
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:12,648
One hour ago.

1285
01:28:12,912 --> 01:28:15,565
"Approved by Harry Osborn."

1286
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,744
Accessing Ravencroft Archive.

1287
01:28:25,257 --> 01:28:27,659
File 713.

1288
01:28:30,137 --> 01:28:31,538
What the hell?

1289
01:28:32,515 --> 01:28:34,390
File 71.

1290
01:28:34,391 --> 01:28:36,851
Subject: Dillon, Max.

1291
01:28:36,852 --> 01:28:38,603
And then I'm gonna kill the light

1292
01:28:38,604 --> 01:28:42,941
so everyone in this city is gonna
know how it feels to live in my world.

1293
01:28:42,942 --> 01:28:45,151
A world without power.

1294
01:28:45,152 --> 01:28:46,611
A world

1295
01:28:46,612 --> 01:28:48,530
without Spider-Man.

1296
01:28:48,531 --> 01:28:50,198
Warning:

01:28:52,618 --> 01:28:55,692
He's busy. You can't
go in there. He's busy.

1299
01:28:56,455 --> 01:28:57,789
What did you do?

1300
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,458
The more relevant question is
what did you do?

1301
01:29:00,459 --> 01:29:04,754
An employee is killed and in your
first action as CEO, you cover it up.

1302
01:29:04,755 --> 01:29:09,384
No, you covered it up. Then you buried
him in the bughouse using my name.

1303
01:29:09,385 --> 01:29:13,429
Ravencroft is a timeworn institution
devoted to mental improvement.

1304
01:29:13,430 --> 01:29:15,598
You are experimenting
on people in there.

1305
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:18,017
Progress has its stepping stones.

1306
01:29:18,018 --> 01:29:21,062
Now, in light of your deceptive
criminal actions, you've been...

1307
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:22,897
How do I put this gently?

1308
01:29:22,898 --> 01:29:24,299
Fired.

1309
01:29:24,358 --> 01:29:27,527
You are not going to bury me too.

1310
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:30,602
Looks to me like you're
halfway in the ground already.

1311
01:29:30,990 --> 01:29:33,017
It's only a matter of time.

1312
01:29:33,284 --> 01:29:35,869
You're going to die
a horrible death.

1313
01:29:35,870 --> 01:29:37,943
Like your father.

1314
01:29:38,205 --> 01:29:40,152
The difference is,

1315
01:29:40,207 --> 01:29:42,484
no one is going to miss you.

1316
01:29:45,129 --> 01:29:46,379
Get him out.

1317
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:47,781
Wait. Wait.

1318
01:29:54,722 --> 01:29:56,795
I know my way out.

1319
01:30:07,109 --> 01:30:08,902
A hundred dollars.
Can you believe that?

1320
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:11,321
Tell you why, you should put
the lid on that but quick.

1321
01:30:11,322 --> 01:30:12,906
I tried. Good luck.

1322
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:16,106
You should tell her to come down here
and find one of those alligators.

1323
01:32:39,928 --> 01:32:41,545
Test.

1324
01:32:41,764 --> 01:32:43,882
My name is Richard Parker.

1325
01:32:44,308 --> 01:32:46,059
Whatever lies will
be told about me,

1326
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,337
I would like the world
to know the truth.

1327
01:32:48,896 --> 01:32:52,398
Oscorp was already a leader
in genetic research

1328
01:32:52,399 --> 01:32:57,487
when Norman Osborn made a deal
with a foreign military organization

1329
01:32:57,488 --> 01:33:00,239
to continue funding my research.

1330
01:33:00,240 --> 01:33:02,950
And I discovered what
they were going to use it for.

1331
01:33:02,951 --> 01:33:05,661
Weapons. Biological
weapons, of course.

1332
01:33:05,662 --> 01:33:07,246
So I refused.

1333
01:33:07,247 --> 01:33:10,625
And now, to eliminate
me from the picture,

1334
01:33:10,626 --> 01:33:14,754
Norman Osborn has
falsified evidence against me

1335
01:33:14,755 --> 01:33:18,659
in order to take
control of my work.

1336
01:33:21,762 --> 01:33:23,387
Can I help you?

1337
01:33:23,388 --> 01:33:25,807
Uh, yeah, you can open the gate.

1338
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:27,350
I'm Harry Osborn.

1339
01:33:27,351 --> 01:33:31,604
Now, there's a patient in that
Isolation Wing that I need to see.

1340
01:33:31,605 --> 01:33:34,732
Joe, this is Mr. Osborn of Oscorp.

1341
01:33:34,733 --> 01:33:37,727
Sorry, without a yellow badge,
I can't let anyone past this point.

1342
01:33:41,031 --> 01:33:43,854
But it doesn't matter because
there's something else...

1343
01:33:44,493 --> 01:33:46,691
that Norman doesn't know.

1344
01:33:47,788 --> 01:33:49,906
The human DNA

1345
01:33:50,082 --> 01:33:53,031
that I implanted in the spiders...

1346
01:33:54,503 --> 01:33:56,029
was my own.

1347
01:33:58,132 --> 01:34:00,675
Which means that without me,

1348
01:34:00,676 --> 01:34:02,749
without my bloodline,

1349
01:34:03,011 --> 01:34:07,632
Oscorp can never replicate
or continue my experiments.

1350
01:34:07,641 --> 01:34:10,268
Keep Electro incubated

1351
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:14,845
with 400 milligrams of sodium
thiopental und phenobarbital.

1352
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:19,318
I have destroyed as much as
possible from the archives.

1353
01:34:20,654 --> 01:34:22,864
But I didn't have time
to kill all of the spiders.

1354
01:34:22,865 --> 01:34:26,325
So as a scientist,
my choice is very clear now.

1355
01:34:26,326 --> 01:34:30,371
I have to disappear. I have to get
as far away from here as I can.

1356
01:34:30,372 --> 01:34:32,540
But as a father,

1357
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,918
it means I may not
see my boy again.

1358
01:34:35,919 --> 01:34:40,415
And nothing is as important to me

1359
01:34:40,757 --> 01:34:43,134
as my son, Peter.

1360
01:34:43,135 --> 01:34:45,287
Nothing in this world.

1361
01:34:45,512 --> 01:34:47,722
But I have a responsibility

1362
01:34:47,723 --> 01:34:50,016
to protect the world
from what I've created,

1363
01:34:50,017 --> 01:34:53,387
and to protect him from
what I know Osborn is capable of.

1364
01:34:53,854 --> 01:34:56,632
People will say I am a monster

1365
01:34:57,232 --> 01:34:59,225
for what I've done.

1366
01:35:00,527 --> 01:35:02,429
And maybe they're right.

1367
01:35:04,781 --> 01:35:07,158
I always thought that I'd have more

1368
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:08,492
time.

1369
01:35:08,493 --> 01:35:10,620
Dad? Dad!

1370
01:35:10,621 --> 01:35:12,318
I'm sorry.

1371
01:35:30,849 --> 01:35:32,842
Sedation off.

1372
01:35:33,977 --> 01:35:35,424
Psst.

1373
01:35:39,358 --> 01:35:41,760
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1374
01:35:41,777 --> 01:35:44,179
All right? But we
don't have much time.

1375
01:35:44,696 --> 01:35:45,947
Who are you?

1376
01:35:45,948 --> 01:35:49,477
I'm Harry Osborn.
I wanna make you a deal.

1377
01:35:50,869 --> 01:35:52,370
I should kill you.

1378
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:54,489
Oh, come on.

1379
01:35:54,581 --> 01:35:56,749
Think bigger, Max.

1380
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,001
I'm not the one you want.

1381
01:35:59,002 --> 01:36:00,544
You want Spider-Man.

1382
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:03,881
And I can give him to you.

1383
01:36:03,882 --> 01:36:08,958
But I need something first.

1384
01:36:09,930 --> 01:36:12,549
I need you to get me into Oscorp.

1385
01:36:12,599 --> 01:36:14,421
Get you in?

1386
01:36:14,476 --> 01:36:15,810
You own it.

1387
01:36:15,811 --> 01:36:18,437
Heh. Uh, not anymore.

1388
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:19,939
Oscorp betrayed us both,

1389
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:24,186
so I can't get in there without you and
you can't get out of here without me.

1390
01:36:24,736 --> 01:36:25,653
What's happening?

1391
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:27,571
Someone pulled an
alarm in the lso Unit.

1392
01:36:27,572 --> 01:36:30,521
Get a containment
team up there now.

1393
01:36:30,784 --> 01:36:32,743
You couldn't possibly
know what I want.

1394
01:36:32,744 --> 01:36:34,704
You submitted the
design for the grid,

1395
01:36:34,705 --> 01:36:36,831
and they stole it.
And now you want it back.

1396
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:38,874
You just wanna take
back what's yours.

1397
01:36:38,875 --> 01:36:41,836
- How?
- It is all the power in the city, Max,

1398
01:36:41,837 --> 01:36:44,005
and it's right at your fingertips.

1399
01:36:44,006 --> 01:36:46,048
And then once you
shut down the grid,

1400
01:36:46,049 --> 01:36:50,219
Spider-Man will come to you,
and I want you to make him bleed.

1401
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:53,377
Break it! Break it!

1402
01:36:56,059 --> 01:36:57,893
Max, we don't have much time!

1403
01:36:57,894 --> 01:37:00,479
Go! Go, go! Go!

1404
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:02,773
Give me one reason
why I should trust you.

1405
01:37:02,774 --> 01:37:04,221
Because I need you!

1406
01:37:05,736 --> 01:37:06,986
You need me?

1407
01:37:06,987 --> 01:37:10,239
Yes. I need you.

1408
01:37:10,240 --> 01:37:14,535
You are my only chance
that I have at surviving.

1409
01:37:14,536 --> 01:37:15,703
You need me?

1410
01:37:15,704 --> 01:37:18,027
Yes. I need you.

1411
01:37:18,707 --> 01:37:20,279
I need you. Please! Please!

1412
01:37:21,752 --> 01:37:23,127
Please!

1413
01:37:23,128 --> 01:37:25,254
I know what it's like
to be thrown away!

1414
01:37:25,255 --> 01:37:26,505
Please, Max!

1415
01:37:26,506 --> 01:37:28,829
I need you! I need you!

1416
01:38:18,850 --> 01:38:20,251
No!

1417
01:38:23,897 --> 01:38:25,924
You wanna be my friend?

1418
01:38:26,191 --> 01:38:28,609
I thought we were already friends.

1419
01:38:29,986 --> 01:38:31,808
I had a friend once.

1420
01:38:32,489 --> 01:38:34,641
It didn't work out.

1421
01:38:35,158 --> 01:38:36,855
Yeah. Me too.

1422
01:38:37,953 --> 01:38:40,447
Then let's go catch a spider.

1423
01:38:43,458 --> 01:38:46,361
You have one new voice message.

1424
01:38:48,255 --> 01:38:50,453
Hi, Peter, it's me.

1425
01:38:50,966 --> 01:38:54,844
Uh, I got in to Oxford.

1426
01:38:54,845 --> 01:38:59,466
Woo-hoo. It's very exciting.

1427
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:03,303
I came by your house
a little bit ago and I, um...

1428
01:39:03,520 --> 01:39:04,812
You weren't there,

1429
01:39:04,813 --> 01:39:08,441
and so I'm on my way
to the airport right now,

1430
01:39:08,442 --> 01:39:11,360
because there's this early
summer class that I found out about,

1431
01:39:11,361 --> 01:39:14,822
and I thought that
it would somehow

1432
01:39:14,823 --> 01:39:19,228
be easier, I guess, this way.

1433
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:23,080
I think that maybe it's time

1434
01:39:23,081 --> 01:39:25,654
to let this go.

1435
01:39:25,917 --> 01:39:28,461
And that's not because
I don't love you.

1436
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:32,162
It's actually because
I do, so, um...

1437
01:39:32,382 --> 01:39:34,159
Okay, bye.

1438
01:39:48,273 --> 01:39:51,096
- We have to move, now.
- Why? What's happened?

1439
01:40:03,622 --> 01:40:05,649
Remember me?

1440
01:40:09,628 --> 01:40:11,212
Oh, my, Oh, my.

1441
01:40:11,213 --> 01:40:13,581
How the tables have turned.

1442
01:40:13,757 --> 01:40:16,383
I know it's hard to admit,

1443
01:40:16,384 --> 01:40:21,130
but how spectacular a move is this?

1444
01:40:21,973 --> 01:40:24,967
- Am I right?
- Right as rain.

1445
01:40:26,186 --> 01:40:29,063
Okay, so, Fairy Godmother,

1446
01:40:29,064 --> 01:40:32,107
it is time to grant me a wish.

1447
01:40:32,108 --> 01:40:36,729
- I want in to Special...
- How dare you come back in here?

1448
01:40:37,531 --> 01:40:41,242
You recalcitrant,
unworthy, defective,

1449
01:40:41,243 --> 01:40:43,611
urchin freaks.

1450
01:40:45,789 --> 01:40:51,366
Oh, God, I'm sorry. That's just not
the answer we were looking for.

1451
01:41:04,599 --> 01:41:06,046
Clear.

1452
01:41:07,477 --> 01:41:10,426
Welcome back to the bonus round.

1453
01:41:11,565 --> 01:41:15,344
Hey, let's take a walk, shall we?

1454
01:41:19,281 --> 01:41:22,324
The grid is all yours.

1455
01:41:54,357 --> 01:41:57,226
The spider venom.
Give it to me.

1456
01:42:02,824 --> 01:42:04,491
What is all this stuff?

1457
01:42:04,492 --> 01:42:06,394
The future.

1458
01:42:19,758 --> 01:42:21,375
Load one up.

1459
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:27,056
It won't work.

1460
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:30,976
We ran every diagnostic test
apart from human trials.

1461
01:42:30,977 --> 01:42:35,348
You've actually already run human trials.
You're just too stupid to know it.

1462
01:42:38,985 --> 01:42:41,433
Do it. Now.

1463
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,758
You had it all this time.

1464
01:44:32,348 --> 01:44:33,974
It's Spider-Man.

1465
01:44:39,689 --> 01:44:41,106
Stop the cab.

1466
01:44:41,107 --> 01:44:43,555
Lady, I ain't even moving.

1467
01:45:08,134 --> 01:45:09,330
Whoa!

1468
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:15,712
- Hi.
- Hi.

1469
01:45:16,017 --> 01:45:18,018
- Did you get my message?
- What message?

1470
01:45:18,019 --> 01:45:20,938
- The message right there.
- Oh, that. That was you?

1471
01:45:20,939 --> 01:45:22,981
- Don't do that.
- I couldn't make it out.

1472
01:45:22,982 --> 01:45:25,510
I'll tell you what it says.
Says, "I love you."

1473
01:45:26,778 --> 01:45:28,896
Because I love you.

1474
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:32,199
- And no offense, but you're wrong.
- I'm wrong about what?

1475
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:34,284
You're wrong about us
being on different paths.

1476
01:45:34,285 --> 01:45:37,029
We're not on different paths.
You're my path.

1477
01:45:37,705 --> 01:45:40,278
And you're always gonna be my path.

1478
01:45:40,834 --> 01:45:44,711
And I know there's a million reasons why
we shouldn't be together. I know that.

1479
01:45:44,712 --> 01:45:46,785
But I'm tired of them.

1480
01:45:49,008 --> 01:45:51,706
I'm tired of every
single one of them.

1481
01:45:51,803 --> 01:45:54,126
We've all gotta make a choice.

1482
01:45:55,640 --> 01:45:57,508
Right? Well, I choose you.

1483
01:45:59,727 --> 01:46:01,228
So

1484
01:46:01,229 --> 01:46:03,176
Here's my thought.

1485
01:46:04,399 --> 01:46:06,142
England.

1486
01:46:07,068 --> 01:46:08,811
Both of us.

1487
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,273
I'm following you now.

1488
01:46:12,407 --> 01:46:14,650
I'm just gonna follow
you everywhere.

1489
01:46:14,826 --> 01:46:17,194
I'm just gonna follow
you the rest of my life.

1490
01:46:17,954 --> 01:46:21,415
I mean, they got crime
there in England.

1491
01:46:21,416 --> 01:46:23,333
- Yeah.
- They got tons of crime, it seems.

1492
01:46:23,334 --> 01:46:25,657
- Tons.
- They got, uh,

1493
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,297
- Jack the Ripper.
- Heh, heh.

1494
01:46:28,298 --> 01:46:29,548
What?

1495
01:46:29,549 --> 01:46:32,301
They haven't caught Jack the
Ripper yet. You didn't know that?

1496
01:46:52,155 --> 01:46:53,727
What the hell is that?

1497
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:05,905
Is that Max?

1498
01:47:06,085 --> 01:47:08,738
He must have cut the
power to the whole city.

1499
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:19,014
PNA 322, you are...

1500
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:21,308
- I'm black.
- I have nothing.

1501
01:47:21,309 --> 01:47:23,894
Hey, I need Tech Ops
up here right now.

1502
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:26,772
The phones are down. Somebody
go down and grab Tech Ops.

1503
01:47:26,773 --> 01:47:28,815
Hey, write down what
you remember, people.

1504
01:47:28,816 --> 01:47:32,819
There's gotta be some kind of blackout
plan, right? Some kind of backup?

1505
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:35,906
There's an emergency
reset at the power plant.

1506
01:47:35,907 --> 01:47:38,992
If he cuts the transmission lines,
they're never gonna get this back up.

1507
01:47:38,993 --> 01:47:41,912
How will I stop him? Every time I get
close, he fries my web shooters.

1508
01:47:41,913 --> 01:47:44,122
- Have you tried grounding them?
- Tried everything.

1509
01:47:44,123 --> 01:47:46,416
- Rubber, plastic...
- Did you try magnetizing them?

1510
01:47:46,417 --> 01:47:49,127
I didn't try magnetizing them.

1511
01:47:49,128 --> 01:47:51,701
Okay, well, remember
8th grade science class?

1512
01:47:51,965 --> 01:47:54,993
If you magnetize a nail
with a battery...

1513
01:47:55,009 --> 01:47:57,286
- It holds an electric charge.
- Yes.

1514
01:47:59,263 --> 01:48:02,724
New York Approach. This is
Pan National 273 on approach.

1515
01:48:02,725 --> 01:48:04,422
How do you hear?

1516
01:48:05,019 --> 01:48:06,603
Approach, do you copy?

1517
01:48:06,604 --> 01:48:08,972
Radio's working. It's not us.

1518
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:20,409
Do not panic. Everyone, please
return to your vehicles.

1519
01:48:20,410 --> 01:48:22,687
Go back to your cars.

1520
01:48:22,745 --> 01:48:24,362
Remain calm.

1521
01:48:25,415 --> 01:48:28,250
Do not panic. Everyone
return to your vehicles.

1522
01:48:28,251 --> 01:48:30,119
- Go into your homes.
- Officer!

1523
01:48:30,128 --> 01:48:31,503
- Spider-Man!
- Oh!

1524
01:48:31,504 --> 01:48:34,006
My father was Captain George
Stacy of the 19th Precinct.

1525
01:48:34,007 --> 01:48:37,009
- I knew who he was. What can we do?
- Jumper cables.

1526
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:39,386
- Jumper cables?
- Yes. And copper wire.

1527
01:48:39,387 --> 01:48:42,210
Am I talking louder than I
usually talk right now?!

1528
01:48:42,557 --> 01:48:44,391
- Yes.
- Ho.

1529
01:48:44,392 --> 01:48:46,912
- Your suit'll ground you.
- All right, do it.

1530
01:48:49,814 --> 01:48:52,941
Okay, good. Try, try, try.
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1531
01:48:52,942 --> 01:48:54,192
Okay, it works, good.

1532
01:48:54,193 --> 01:48:56,111
That is why you were
number two at Midtown.

1533
01:48:56,112 --> 01:48:57,308
- Rub it in. Okay.
- Heh.

1534
01:48:59,365 --> 01:49:01,199
- I gotta go.
- I'm coming with you.

1535
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:03,285
- You're not coming with me.
- Yes, I am.

1536
01:49:03,286 --> 01:49:04,786
- It's too dangerous.
- I'm coming.

1537
01:49:04,787 --> 01:49:07,456
I've seen the grid specs and I
know how to reset the system.

1538
01:49:07,457 --> 01:49:11,668
- I'm coming with you! You need me!
- Okay, shut up. You're coming with me!

1539
01:49:11,669 --> 01:49:13,295
Shut the thing.

1540
01:49:13,296 --> 01:49:15,380
Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me.

1541
01:49:16,841 --> 01:49:18,425
Peter!

1542
01:49:18,426 --> 01:49:20,510
We still don't have
backup generators.

1543
01:49:20,511 --> 01:49:22,262
Get me Engineering!

1544
01:49:22,263 --> 01:49:23,680
I need a respirator right now.

1545
01:49:23,681 --> 01:49:25,766
They're battery-operated.
I'll get it.

1546
01:49:25,767 --> 01:49:27,339
Hang on.

1547
01:49:27,685 --> 01:49:29,132
Okay.

1548
01:49:51,542 --> 01:49:54,086
Do you see me now, Spider-Man?

1549
01:49:54,087 --> 01:49:57,741
It's time to meet our destiny.

1550
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:15,148
Tower, we're experiencing some
kind of electrical disturbance.

1551
01:50:15,149 --> 01:50:18,052
Instruments are going
haywire. Radar is down.

1552
01:50:18,111 --> 01:50:20,730
We're flying blind out
here. Do you copy?

1553
01:50:24,951 --> 01:50:27,619
Tower, repeat: We are standby
only. What is happening?

1554
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:31,123
Sir? There are two inbound
flights on intersecting paths.

1555
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:33,083
- Time to impact?
- Four and a half minutes.

1556
01:50:33,084 --> 01:50:34,610
Clock it right now.

1557
01:50:48,182 --> 01:50:50,684
You're too late, Spider-Man.

1558
01:50:50,685 --> 01:50:52,602
I designed this power grid.

1559
01:50:52,603 --> 01:50:54,437
Now I'm gonna take back

1560
01:50:54,438 --> 01:50:56,523
what is rightfully mine.

1561
01:50:56,524 --> 01:50:58,942
I will control everything.

1562
01:50:58,943 --> 01:51:02,821
And I will be like a god to them.

1563
01:51:02,822 --> 01:51:04,519
A god named Sparkles?

1564
01:51:14,458 --> 01:51:16,126
Not this time.

1565
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:18,245
Is that all you got?
Come on!

1566
01:51:37,690 --> 01:51:39,262
Come on!

1567
01:51:43,112 --> 01:51:44,529
You ready to give up?

1568
01:51:54,957 --> 01:51:57,860
Oh, thank you, Gwen Stacy.

1569
01:52:08,179 --> 01:52:10,055
Just shake it off.
It's just your bones,

1570
01:52:10,056 --> 01:52:13,335
and your muscles
and your organs. Hunh!

1571
01:52:15,853 --> 01:52:17,721
Oh, boy.

1572
01:52:24,695 --> 01:52:26,096
I hate this song!

1573
01:52:46,676 --> 01:52:48,077
Spider-Man,

1574
01:52:48,094 --> 01:52:49,837
bet you never saw this coming.

1575
01:52:57,103 --> 01:52:59,229
Really? You web me to a car?

1576
01:52:59,230 --> 01:53:00,772
What are you, a caveman?

1577
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:02,232
You shouldn't be here.

1578
01:53:02,233 --> 01:53:05,068
You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you!

1579
01:53:05,069 --> 01:53:07,445
- What are you doing here?!
- I know the grid specs.

1580
01:53:07,446 --> 01:53:08,989
I can reset the system!

1581
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:11,449
You can't be here right now.
I'm not messing around.

1582
01:53:11,450 --> 01:53:13,410
You can't be here right now.
This is insane.

1583
01:53:13,411 --> 01:53:16,621
Nobody makes my decisions
for me. All right? Nobody.

1584
01:53:16,622 --> 01:53:19,070
This is my choice, okay?

1585
01:53:19,375 --> 01:53:22,085
- My choice. This is mine.
- Oh!

1586
01:53:22,086 --> 01:53:24,504
- Now, how do we stop him?
- Okay, so he's electric,

1587
01:53:24,505 --> 01:53:26,214
he's like a battery.

1588
01:53:26,215 --> 01:53:28,133
What happens if you
overcharge a battery?

1589
01:53:28,134 --> 01:53:29,384
- It explodes.
- Right.

1590
01:53:29,385 --> 01:53:31,219
So we use his power
against him. Perfect.

1591
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:33,305
- Okay.
- I think I can reconnect the power lines.

1592
01:53:33,306 --> 01:53:35,056
But I need you to reset the system.

1593
01:53:35,057 --> 01:53:38,143
Okay, when I say you turn
that power on, you turn it on.

1594
01:53:38,144 --> 01:53:40,687
- No matter what. No matter what.
- Peter.

1595
01:53:45,484 --> 01:53:47,227
Go, go!

1596
01:54:38,871 --> 01:54:41,319
Sixty seconds to impact.

1597
01:55:06,273 --> 01:55:07,674
Aah!

1598
01:55:15,533 --> 01:55:16,783
Now, Gwen, now!

1599
01:55:16,784 --> 01:55:18,310
Do it now!

1600
01:55:43,519 --> 01:55:45,091
Uni 687...

1601
01:55:55,823 --> 01:55:59,022
This is LaGuardia Tower.
Turn immediately to heading 280.

1602
01:55:59,326 --> 01:56:02,579
You have incoming traffic.
I repeat: 280.

1603
01:56:02,580 --> 01:56:04,277
Defend immediately.

1604
01:56:14,592 --> 01:56:16,335
Whoo!

1605
01:56:19,388 --> 01:56:20,789
Yes!

1606
01:56:21,015 --> 01:56:23,475
All right, people, back to work.
Let's land these planes.

1607
01:56:23,476 --> 01:56:25,253
I'll be back in a minute.

1608
01:56:25,394 --> 01:56:27,896
Oh, thank God. All right!

1609
01:56:27,897 --> 01:56:30,148
All right, we're back.
Everyone, let's go.

1610
01:57:05,935 --> 01:57:07,977
I think we can still
make your flight.

1611
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:18,096
Gwen, stay there.

1612
01:57:43,764 --> 01:57:45,586
Peter.

1613
01:57:46,100 --> 01:57:49,674
When you said Spider-Man said no,

1614
01:57:49,770 --> 01:57:54,065
you meant you said no.

1615
01:57:54,066 --> 01:57:56,734
Harry, what did you do?

1616
01:57:56,735 --> 01:57:59,137
What you made me do.

1617
01:57:59,280 --> 01:58:01,030
You were my friend

1618
01:58:01,031 --> 01:58:03,866
and you betrayed me!

1619
01:58:03,867 --> 01:58:05,393
No.

1620
01:58:05,452 --> 01:58:07,775
- I was trying to protect you.
- Oh.

1621
01:58:08,122 --> 01:58:09,622
Look at me.

1622
01:58:09,623 --> 01:58:12,117
Hey, it's gonna be okay.
This is gonna be all right.

1623
01:58:12,126 --> 01:58:13,778
You don't give people hope.

1624
01:58:14,086 --> 01:58:15,878
You take it away.

1625
01:58:15,879 --> 01:58:17,326
No, Harry.

1626
01:58:17,506 --> 01:58:19,716
I'm gonna take away yours.

1627
01:58:19,717 --> 01:58:21,509
- No. Gwen, run!
- Aah!

1628
01:58:21,510 --> 01:58:23,082
Harry!

1629
01:58:23,304 --> 01:58:24,846
Harry, put her down!

1630
01:58:41,530 --> 01:58:43,615
Harry, stop this right now!

1631
01:58:43,616 --> 01:58:46,735
This isn't you, Harry. This is
not you. Harry, put her down.

1632
01:58:46,910 --> 01:58:49,078
- Harry.
- Harry is dead!

1633
01:58:49,079 --> 01:58:52,290
Harry, this is between you
and me. You wanna fight?

1634
01:58:52,291 --> 01:58:54,739
Fight me! Let her go!

1635
01:58:54,877 --> 01:58:56,403
Okay.

1636
01:58:57,212 --> 01:58:58,238
No!

1637
01:59:06,138 --> 01:59:08,791
- You okay?
- Mm-mm.

1638
01:59:12,853 --> 01:59:15,381
I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna
put you down right here.

1639
02:00:35,227 --> 02:00:36,549
Peter?

1640
02:01:39,875 --> 02:01:42,494
Hey. Hey.

1641
02:01:45,339 --> 02:01:46,786
Gwen?

1642
02:01:49,051 --> 02:01:50,426
Hey.

1643
02:01:50,427 --> 02:01:51,953
Hey!

1644
02:01:56,391 --> 02:01:57,883
Gwen?

1645
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:00,921
Hey.

1646
02:02:04,066 --> 02:02:05,513
Breathe.

1647
02:02:06,652 --> 02:02:08,975
Hey, Gwen.

1648
02:02:09,571 --> 02:02:10,972
Hey.

1649
02:02:14,326 --> 02:02:15,773
Hey.

1650
02:02:17,788 --> 02:02:19,485
You're okay.

1651
02:02:22,835 --> 02:02:24,327
Gwen?

1652
02:02:29,842 --> 02:02:31,592
Stay with me, stay with me.

1653
02:02:31,593 --> 02:02:34,371
Stay with me, stay with me.
You stay with me.

1654
02:02:39,726 --> 02:02:41,218
Gwen.

1655
02:02:43,522 --> 02:02:44,969
Gwen!

1656
02:02:47,568 --> 02:02:50,517
No, please, please.

1657
02:02:52,656 --> 02:02:54,433
Please.

1658
02:03:00,914 --> 02:03:03,567
I can't do this without you.

1659
02:05:05,831 --> 02:05:07,653
Leave us.

1660
02:05:11,545 --> 02:05:13,379
You've made progress.

1661
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:16,841
I've identified several
worthy candidates.

1662
02:05:16,842 --> 02:05:19,176
Now that Spider-Man's gone,

1663
02:05:19,177 --> 02:05:22,471
this city will never be the same.

1664
02:05:22,472 --> 02:05:25,266
Oh, I'm counting on that.

1665
02:05:25,267 --> 02:05:27,101
Speaking of progress,

1666
02:05:27,102 --> 02:05:28,549
you're looking better.

1667
02:05:29,104 --> 02:05:31,347
It comes and goes.

1668
02:05:32,649 --> 02:05:34,517
Tell me more.

1669
02:05:34,693 --> 02:05:36,485
How many men did you have in mind?

1670
02:05:36,486 --> 02:05:38,738
I wanna keep it small.

1671
02:05:38,739 --> 02:05:42,366
Everything you need
is already at Oscorp.

1672
02:05:44,077 --> 02:05:45,828
Access granted.

1673
02:05:45,829 --> 02:05:48,039
Welcome, Mr. Fiers.

1674
02:05:48,040 --> 02:05:49,999
Who's our first volunteer?

1675
02:05:50,000 --> 02:05:52,043
Aleksei Sytsevich.

1676
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:54,462
Currently serving a life sentence.

1677
02:05:54,463 --> 02:05:55,921
He is

1678
02:05:55,922 --> 02:05:58,575
most eager to join us.

1679
02:05:59,009 --> 02:06:00,706
Good.

1680
02:06:00,969 --> 02:06:03,371
Start with him.

1681
02:06:03,472 --> 02:06:05,264
Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich

1682
02:06:05,265 --> 02:06:07,433
was broken out of
a classified penitentiary

1683
02:06:07,434 --> 02:06:10,853
known simply as the Vault
by an unknown team of men.

1684
02:06:10,854 --> 02:06:13,522
It's yet another example
of increased criminal activity

1685
02:06:13,523 --> 02:06:16,942
since the disappearance
of Spider-Man five months ago.

1686
02:06:16,943 --> 02:06:20,446
The web-slinger's absence has left
a hole in the heart of the city.

1687
02:06:20,447 --> 02:06:23,282
Believe it or not, even the New
York City Police Department

1688
02:06:23,283 --> 02:06:25,534
has joined the chorus
of New Yorkers in hoping

1689
02:06:25,535 --> 02:06:27,870
for the return
of the web-slinger.

1690
02:06:27,871 --> 02:06:30,444
The entire world seems to be
asking the same question:

1691
02:06:30,707 --> 02:06:32,333
Where is Spider-Man?

1692
02:06:34,086 --> 02:06:36,909
Oh. Too bad about that spider guy.

1693
02:06:38,048 --> 02:06:41,327
Too bad he's disappeared. Seems
like everybody really needs him.

1694
02:06:42,928 --> 02:06:44,625
Where you going?

1695
02:06:45,430 --> 02:06:48,504
- Eat my cereal.
- Peter.

1696
02:06:48,517 --> 02:06:50,590
Where you going?

1697
02:07:00,153 --> 02:07:01,600
I don't know.

1698
02:07:03,490 --> 02:07:05,563
You know, it's so funny.
I've been...

1699
02:07:05,909 --> 02:07:09,153
I've been trying to clean up
around here, get organized,

1700
02:07:09,162 --> 02:07:13,783
and been putting some
of Ben's stuff in boxes.

1701
02:07:14,167 --> 02:07:18,288
And it's so funny, the heavier
the box gets, the lighter I feel.

1702
02:07:18,630 --> 02:07:20,923
- You're throwing his stuff away?
- No.

1703
02:07:20,924 --> 02:07:22,508
No. God, no.

1704
02:07:22,509 --> 02:07:26,038
I couldn't do that.
It's part of me.

1705
02:07:26,513 --> 02:07:29,883
I'm just finding

1706
02:07:30,433 --> 02:07:32,301
a better place for it.

1707
02:07:35,647 --> 02:07:37,970
I'm gonna take one last look,

1708
02:07:39,025 --> 02:07:41,052
and I'm gonna put it
where it belongs.

1709
02:08:05,927 --> 02:08:10,548
It's easy to feel hopeful on
a beautiful day like today.

1710
02:08:11,349 --> 02:08:14,628
But there will be dark days
ahead of us too.

1711
02:08:15,061 --> 02:08:18,010
There will be days
where you feel all alone.

1712
02:08:20,150 --> 02:08:22,973
And that's when hope
is needed most.

1713
02:08:24,029 --> 02:08:26,477
No matter how buried it gets,

1714
02:08:26,907 --> 02:08:29,241
or how lost you feel,

1715
02:08:29,242 --> 02:08:31,202
you must promise me

1716
02:08:31,203 --> 02:08:34,948
that you will hold on to hope.

1717
02:08:36,249 --> 02:08:37,901
Keep it alive.

1718
02:08:38,418 --> 02:08:41,295
We have to be greater
than what we suffer.

1719
02:08:41,296 --> 02:08:43,005
My wish for you

1720
02:08:43,006 --> 02:08:45,534
is to become hope.

1721
02:08:45,592 --> 02:08:47,460
People need that.

1722
02:08:48,386 --> 02:08:50,721
And even if we fail,

1723
02:08:50,722 --> 02:08:53,170
what better way is there to live?

1724
02:08:54,351 --> 02:08:56,477
As we look around here today

1725
02:08:56,478 --> 02:09:00,098
at all of the people
who helped make us who we are,

1726
02:09:00,398 --> 02:09:03,221
I know it feels like
we're saying goodbye.

1727
02:09:03,360 --> 02:09:06,278
But we will carry
a piece of each other

1728
02:09:06,279 --> 02:09:09,432
into everything that we do next,

1729
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:14,104
to remind us of who we are,

1730
02:09:15,580 --> 02:09:17,456
and of who we're meant to be.

1731
02:09:19,668 --> 02:09:22,086
I've had a great
four years with you.

1732
02:09:22,087 --> 02:09:24,489
I'll miss you all very much.

1733
02:09:39,396 --> 02:09:40,797
Whoa!

1734
02:09:46,486 --> 02:09:47,978
Let's go! Move it.

1735
02:09:55,954 --> 02:09:57,822
Get down! Take cover!

1736
02:10:01,251 --> 02:10:05,796

Street where it is complete chaos.

1737
02:10:05,797 --> 02:10:08,257

weaponized armored suit

1744
02:10:41,458 --> 02:10:44,953

- Civilian in our line of sight.

1747
02:10:53,762 --> 02:10:56,005

You go take care of your mom. Okay?

1757
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:49,013
All right, get out of here. Go. Go.

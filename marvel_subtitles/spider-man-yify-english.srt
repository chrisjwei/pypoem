1
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,460
Who am I? You sure you want to know?

2
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:14,920
The story of my life
is not for the faint of heart.

3
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:17,715
If somebody said
it was a happy little tale...

4
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,385
...if somebody told you I was just an
average guy, not a care in the world...

5
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,345
...somebody lied.

6
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:28,810
But let me assure you, this,
like any story worth telling...

7
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:30,400
...is all about a girl.

8
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,730
That girl. The girl next door.
Mary Jane Watson.

9
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,985
The woman I've loved
since before I liked girls.

10
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,820
I'd like to tell you that's me
next to her.

11
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,990
Aw, heck, I'd even take him.

12
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,911
Hey! Stop the bus!

13
00:03:48,912 --> 00:03:50,080
That's me.

14
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:52,165
Tell him to stop! Please!

15
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:53,583
Stop!

16
00:03:53,792 --> 00:03:56,003
Hey! Stop the bus!

17
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,256
Stop! He's been chasing us
since Woodhaven.

18
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:00,674
Catch a cab, Parker!

19
00:04:05,137 --> 00:04:07,931
Thank you. I'm sorry I'm late.

20
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:14,646
What a geek!

21
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:19,526
- Don't even think about it.
- You're so lame, Parker.

22
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,278
Would you date him?

23
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:41,381
Midtown High seniors.

24
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:45,260
No wandering. Proceed direct...
Knock it off.

25
00:04:45,552 --> 00:04:49,014
Remember, it is a privilege
to be here.

26
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,643
We're guests of Columbia University's
Science Department.

27
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:55,062
So behave accordingly.

28
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:58,273
Let's not have a repeat
of our trip to the planetarium.

29
00:04:58,482 --> 00:05:00,108
Come on, stay together.

30
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:03,195
Proceed up the steps
and into the building.

31
00:05:04,363 --> 00:05:07,407
- Where were you?
- Checking out the library.

32
00:05:07,574 --> 00:05:10,118
- Looking at the books.
- Yeah, right.

33
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:15,707
- Can we drive around the corner?
- Why?

34
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,709
The entrance is right there.

35
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:21,588
Dad, this is public school.
I can't show up in a Rolls.

36
00:05:21,797 --> 00:05:24,132
I should trade my car for a Jetta...

37
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:27,094
...because you flunked out
of private school?

38
00:05:27,386 --> 00:05:30,430
- It wasn't for me.
- Of course it was.

39
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:35,435
- Don't ever be ashamed of who you are.
- I'm not ashamed of who I am.

40
00:05:35,644 --> 00:05:36,937
It's just...

41
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:38,563
Just what, Harry?

42
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:40,274
Forget it.

43
00:05:43,277 --> 00:05:44,611
Pete!

44
00:05:45,028 --> 00:05:47,531
- Hi, Harry.
- Hey, man. What's up?

45
00:05:48,407 --> 00:05:50,617
- Won't you be needing this?
- Thanks.

46
00:05:51,576 --> 00:05:55,539
- This is my father, Norman Osborn.
- I've heard so much about you.

47
00:05:55,747 --> 00:05:59,209
- It's an honor, sir.
- Harry says you're a science whiz.

48
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:02,296
I'm something of a scientist myself.

49
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:05,632
I read your research
on nanotechnology. Brilliant.

50
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,844
- You understood it?
- Yes, I wrote a paper on it.

51
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:12,347
Impressive.
Your parents must be very proud.

52
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:17,060
- I live with my aunt and uncle.
- Hey, you two! Let's move!

53
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:20,897
- Nice to meet you.
- Hope to see you again.

54
00:06:23,233 --> 00:06:26,737
- He doesn't seem so bad.
- Not if you're a genius.

55
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:28,864
I think he wants to adopt you.

56
00:06:29,031 --> 00:06:33,744
There are over 32,000 known species
of spider in the world.

57
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:37,748
They're in the order Araneae,
divided into three suborders.

58
00:06:37,956 --> 00:06:39,041
That's amazing!

59
00:06:39,207 --> 00:06:43,128
This is the most advanced electron
microscope on the East Coast.

60
00:06:43,462 --> 00:06:45,505
It's unreal.

61
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:48,467
Arachnids from all three
groups possess...

62
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:52,179
...varying strengths
to help them search for food.

63
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:56,600
For example, the Delena spider,
family Sparassidae...

64
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:00,938
...has the ability to jump
to catch its prey.

65
00:07:01,104 --> 00:07:02,856
For the school paper?

66
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:12,366
Next, we have the net web spider,
family Filistatidae...

67
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:14,451
...genus Kukulcania.

68
00:07:14,701 --> 00:07:19,039
Spins a funnel-shaped web whose
strands have a tensile strength...

69
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:24,503
...proportionately equal to
the high-tension wires used in bridges.

70
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:26,630
- Leave him alone.
- Or what?

71
00:07:26,797 --> 00:07:29,800
Or his father will fire your father.

72
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,552
What's Daddy gonna do? Sue me?

73
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,222
What is going on?

74
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,475
The next person who talks
will fail this course.

75
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:40,686
- This spider...
- Let's go.

76
00:07:40,852 --> 00:07:45,023
...hunts using reflexes with
nerve-conduction velocity so fast...

77
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:48,735
...that some researchers believe
it borders on precognition.

78
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:51,071
- An early awareness of danger.
- Jerks.

79
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,031
A spider-sense.

80
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:55,325
Hey, look at that spider.

81
00:07:55,492 --> 00:07:59,913
Some spiders change colors
to blend into their environment.

82
00:08:00,163 --> 00:08:02,082
It's a defense mechanism.

83
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:05,544
Peter, what makes you think
I'd want to know that?

84
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:06,920
Who wouldn't?

85
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:10,924
Over five painstaking years,
Columbia's research facility...

86
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:15,470
- You gonna talk to her now?
- Oh, no. Come on. You talk to her.

87
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:20,434
With these DNA blueprints, we have
begun what was once thought impossible.

88
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:24,313
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, hateful little things.

89
00:08:24,521 --> 00:08:25,897
I love them!

90
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,108
Yeah, me too.

91
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:32,946
You know, spiders can change
their color...

92
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:36,950
...to blend into their environment.
- Really?

93
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:41,246
- Yeah, it's a defense mechanism.
- Cool.

94
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:44,833
- transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

95
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,128
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

96
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:52,966
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

97
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,635
There's 14.

98
00:08:55,093 --> 00:08:56,470
I beg your pardon?

99
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:59,181
- One's missing.
- Yeah.

100
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,728
I guess the researchers
are working on that one.

101
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:09,942
Do you know that this is the largest
electron microscope on the East Coast?

102
00:09:10,108 --> 00:09:14,196
You were talking throughout
that woman's entire presentation.

103
00:09:14,363 --> 00:09:16,114
Let's talk about listening.

104
00:09:20,202 --> 00:09:24,289
I don't know what it's like
at those fancy private schools...

105
00:09:24,498 --> 00:09:26,375
...but at Midtown High...

106
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:38,595
Could I take your picture?
I need one with a student in it.

107
00:09:38,762 --> 00:09:40,222
- Sure.
- Great.

108
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,724
Where do you want me?
Over here?

109
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:44,268
Yeah, that's great.

110
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,353
Don't make me look ugly.

111
00:09:46,728 --> 00:09:48,563
That's impossible.

112
00:09:55,821 --> 00:09:57,072
Perfect.

113
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:06,373
- Is that good?
- Great.

114
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,297
That's great.

115
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,887
M.J., let's go!

116
00:10:22,431 --> 00:10:25,017
Wait. Thanks!

117
00:10:38,488 --> 00:10:41,241
Parker, let's do it.

118
00:10:57,966 --> 00:11:01,428
We've solved the horizon glide
and the balance issues.

119
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:04,139
I've already seen the glider.

120
00:11:04,556 --> 00:11:06,600
That's not what I'm here for.

121
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,478
General Slocum, good to see you again.

122
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:12,481
Mr. Balkan, Mr. Fargas.

123
00:11:12,731 --> 00:11:14,566
- Norman.
- Mr. Osborn.

124
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:18,278
Always a pleasure to have
our board of directors visit.

125
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:21,907
I want the report on human
performance enhancers.

126
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:26,578
We tried vapor inhalation with rats.
Their strength increased by 800%.

127
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:28,622
- Excellent.
- Any side effects?

128
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:29,873
Once.

129
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,709
All the tests since
have been successful.

130
00:11:32,876 --> 00:11:36,630
In the trial that went wrong,
what were the side effects?

131
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:39,132
Violence, aggression...

132
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,051
...and insanity.

133
00:11:41,218 --> 00:11:43,971
- What do you recommend?
- That was only one test.

134
00:11:44,221 --> 00:11:48,058
Except for Dr. Stromm,
our staff certifies the product...

135
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:51,144
...ready for human testing.
- Dr. Stromm?

136
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:56,149
We need to take the whole line
back to formula.

137
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,820
- Back to formula?
- Dr. Osborn.

138
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:02,823
I'll be frank with you.

139
00:12:03,073 --> 00:12:07,911
I never supported your program. We
have my predecessor to thank for that.

140
00:12:08,078 --> 00:12:10,831
The general has approved
Quest Aerospace...

141
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:13,917
...to build a prototype
of their exoskeleton.

142
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:18,171
- They test in two weeks.
- And if your performance enhancers...

143
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:22,426
...have not had a successful
human trial by that date...

144
00:12:22,676 --> 00:12:27,055
...I'm gonna pull your funding.
I'm going to give it to them.

145
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,517
Gentlemen. Ladies.

146
00:12:35,606 --> 00:12:41,028
And the Lord said, "Let there be light."
And voilà! There is light.

147
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,363
Forty soft, glowing watts of it.

148
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:48,368
Good boy. God will be thrilled.
Just don't fall on your ass.

149
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:51,121
I'm already on my ass, May.

150
00:12:51,288 --> 00:12:55,792
When the plant's senior electrician
is laid off after 35 years...

151
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:58,670
...what would you call it?
I am on my ass.

152
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:01,214
Hand me that dish. The green one.

153
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:04,217
The corporation is downsizing
the people...

154
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:06,553
...and upsizing their profits.

155
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:09,723
Oh, Ben, you'll get another job
somewhere.

156
00:13:10,724 --> 00:13:13,644
Well, let's look
in the paper and see.

157
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:17,564
There are the want ads.
What do we got here?

158
00:13:17,731 --> 00:13:19,358
Computer...

159
00:13:19,566 --> 00:13:23,320
Computer salesman, computer engineer,
computer analyst.

160
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:27,240
My Lord, even the computers
need analysts these days.

161
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:32,829
I'm 68. I'm too old for computers, and
besides, I have a family to provide for.

162
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:35,916
I love you. And Peter loves you.

163
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,419
You're the most responsible man
I've ever known.

164
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:44,091
We've been down-and-out before.
But somehow, we survive.

165
00:13:45,217 --> 00:13:49,513
Hi, sweetie. You're just...
Just in time for dinner.

166
00:13:49,721 --> 00:13:52,265
How you doing? How was the field trip?

167
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:55,269
I don't feel well.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

168
00:13:55,435 --> 00:13:57,938
- You won't have a bite?
- Had a bite.

169
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,524
Did you get some pictures, Peter?

170
00:14:01,358 --> 00:14:04,194
I gotta crash. Everything's fine.

171
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,197
What's that all about?

172
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:30,679
In this recombination lab...

173
00:14:30,846 --> 00:14:35,475
...we use synthesized transfer RNA
to encode an entirely new genome...

174
00:14:35,684 --> 00:14:38,729
...combining the genetic
information from all three...

175
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:43,734
...into these 15 genetically
designed super-spiders.

176
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:02,169
Dr. Osborn, please.
The performance enhancers aren't ready.

177
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:05,672
The data just doesn't justify
this test.

178
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,509
Now, I'm asking you for the last time.
We can't do this.

179
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:11,887
Don't be a coward.

180
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:14,931
Risks are part of laboratory science.

181
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,852
Let me reschedule,
with a medical staff and a volunteer.

182
00:15:19,061 --> 00:15:21,521
- Just give me two weeks.
- Two weeks?

183
00:15:21,688 --> 00:15:26,193
In two weeks? We'll have lost the contract
to Quest and OSCORP will be dead.

184
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,112
Sometimes you gotta
do things yourself.

185
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,949
- Get me the Promachloraperazine.
- For what?

186
00:15:32,115 --> 00:15:35,869
It begins catalyzation when the vapor
hits the bloodstream.

187
00:15:38,789 --> 00:15:40,457
40,000 years of evolution...

188
00:15:40,624 --> 00:15:44,378
...and we've barely tapped
the vastness of human potential.

189
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,559
Oh, that's cold.

190
00:16:58,035 --> 00:16:59,286
Norman?

191
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:05,083
Norman!

192
00:17:15,802 --> 00:17:17,137
Oh, my God.

193
00:17:18,639 --> 00:17:20,057
Oh, my God!

194
00:17:22,726 --> 00:17:24,561
Oh, my God! Norman!

195
00:17:40,953 --> 00:17:42,579
Back to formula?

196
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,699
Weird.

197
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,003
- Peter?
- Yeah?

198
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:32,963
Are you all right?

199
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,508
I'm fine.

200
00:18:37,092 --> 00:18:40,470
- Any better this morning? Any change?
- Change?

201
00:18:41,471 --> 00:18:43,390
Yep. Big change.

202
00:18:43,557 --> 00:18:47,561
- Well, hurry up. You'll be late.
- Right.

203
00:19:05,954 --> 00:19:07,331
Okay.

204
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:15,839
- Goodness me!
- Jeez. I thought you were sick.

205
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:17,716
- I got better.
- See?

206
00:19:17,883 --> 00:19:21,261
- Bye, guys.
- Have you got your lunch money?

207
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:25,098
Don't forget, we're painting
the kitchen after school.

208
00:19:25,265 --> 00:19:28,060
Sure, Uncle Ben.
Don't start without me.

209
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,354
And don't start up with me.

210
00:19:31,939 --> 00:19:35,609
Teenagers. Raging hormones.
They never change.

211
00:19:36,568 --> 00:19:40,280
You're trash!
You're always gonna be trash!

212
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:44,034
- I have to go to school.
- Who's stopping you?

213
00:20:01,426 --> 00:20:03,095
Hi, M.J.

214
00:20:03,971 --> 00:20:05,472
Hey, M.J.

215
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:10,269
I don't know if you realize this, but
we've been neighbors since I was 6.

216
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:13,772
And I was wondering
if we could get together sometime?

217
00:20:13,981 --> 00:20:15,274
I got the car. Hop in.

218
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,318
Do something fun?
Or, I don't know.

219
00:20:18,527 --> 00:20:22,364
I thought it'd be time
to get to know each other.

220
00:20:22,614 --> 00:20:23,865
Or not.

221
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:32,040
Sorry, Parker, the bus is full!

222
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:36,128
- Stop the bus!
- Catch a cab!

223
00:20:36,545 --> 00:20:38,171
Tell him to stop.

224
00:20:38,839 --> 00:20:40,841
- Check him out!
- Dork!

225
00:21:03,322 --> 00:21:04,573
Dad!

226
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,908
Dad, are you all right?

227
00:21:07,743 --> 00:21:09,036
Harry.

228
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:14,374
What are you doing on the floor?

229
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,876
I don't know.

230
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,046
Have you been there all night?

231
00:21:21,048 --> 00:21:22,299
Last night I was...

232
00:21:24,635 --> 00:21:25,886
What?

233
00:21:27,137 --> 00:21:29,556
- I don't remember.
- Mr. Osborn?

234
00:21:29,765 --> 00:21:31,433
Sir, I asked her to wait.

235
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,938
- My father's not feeling well...
- Mr. Osborn, Dr. Stromm is dead.

236
00:21:36,104 --> 00:21:37,147
What?

237
00:21:37,314 --> 00:21:40,901
They found his body in the lab.
He's been murdered, sir.

238
00:21:41,068 --> 00:21:44,446
- What?
- And the flight suit and the glider...

239
00:21:44,613 --> 00:21:46,615
- What about it?
- Stolen, sir.

240
00:22:11,556 --> 00:22:14,309
Wow! Great reflexes!

241
00:22:15,185 --> 00:22:17,354
- Thanks.
- No problem.

242
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:22,359
Hey, you have blue eyes.
I didn't notice without your glasses.

243
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:24,778
You just get contacts?

244
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:33,704
Well, see you.

245
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:18,999
- What happened?
- He's freaking weird.

246
00:23:19,458 --> 00:23:20,834
Did you see that?

247
00:23:22,419 --> 00:23:24,087
Parker?

248
00:23:55,953 --> 00:23:58,372
- It's a fight!
- Think you're funny?

249
00:23:58,538 --> 00:24:01,541
- It was an accident.
- So is my breaking your teeth.

250
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:04,461
- Flash, stop.
- I don't want to fight you.

251
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:08,048
- I wouldn't want to fight me neither.
- Kick his ass.

252
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,277
Help him, Harry.

253
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,741
How'd he do that?

254
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:37,077
Which one?

255
00:24:37,244 --> 00:24:38,620
He's all yours, man.

256
00:24:54,136 --> 00:24:55,846
Flash, get up!

257
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:00,601
Jesus, Parker, you are a freak.

258
00:25:02,519 --> 00:25:04,021
That was amazing.

259
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,940
I'm out of here. Come on.

260
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:53,171
Go, web!

261
00:26:54,756 --> 00:26:56,383
Fly.

262
00:26:57,968 --> 00:27:00,053
Up, up and away, web.

263
00:27:01,638 --> 00:27:03,056
Shazam!

264
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,891
Go! Go!

265
00:27:05,142 --> 00:27:06,893
Go, web, go!

266
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,762
Tallyho.

267
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:28,266
- Is she back with the beer yet?
- What?

268
00:28:28,475 --> 00:28:29,726
Bring me some beer.

269
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:32,479
- Get up off your ass.
- I paid for beer...

270
00:28:32,646 --> 00:28:34,147
- Stop yelling.
- Stop it!

271
00:28:34,314 --> 00:28:36,650
You're as stupid as your mother.

272
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:41,113
Where's she going?
Where you going?

273
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:45,534
The dishes aren't done.
Somebody's gotta do dishes.

274
00:28:45,742 --> 00:28:49,037
- Why don't you do them?
- Get in here and do the dishes.

275
00:28:49,246 --> 00:28:53,375
- You do them. They're yours, anyway.
- I'm going out!

276
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:56,086
- Were you listening to that?
- No.

277
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:59,673
Well, I heard, but I was
just taking out the trash.

278
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,592
I guess you can always hear us.

279
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:05,053
Everybody shouts.

280
00:29:05,512 --> 00:29:07,639
Your aunt and uncle don't.

281
00:29:07,806 --> 00:29:10,350
Oh, they can scream
pretty good sometimes.

282
00:29:11,768 --> 00:29:15,981
Listen, M.J., about today
at school with Flash...

283
00:29:16,231 --> 00:29:17,858
You really freaked us out.

284
00:29:18,066 --> 00:29:20,319
I'm sorry. Is he okay?

285
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:24,573
He's just happy you didn't give him
a black eye for graduation.

286
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:30,871
So where are you going
after you graduate?

287
00:29:35,626 --> 00:29:37,919
I wanna move into the city.

288
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:43,634
And hopefully, get a job
as a photographer.

289
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,637
Work my way through college.

290
00:29:47,638 --> 00:29:48,972
What about you?

291
00:29:49,139 --> 00:29:51,141
Headed for the city too.

292
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:54,102
Can't wait to get out of here.

293
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,772
I wanna...

294
00:29:58,023 --> 00:29:59,524
What?

295
00:30:02,361 --> 00:30:04,613
No, come on. Try me.

296
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:07,032
I wanna...

297
00:30:08,158 --> 00:30:09,493
...act...

298
00:30:10,661 --> 00:30:12,162
...on-stage.

299
00:30:12,746 --> 00:30:14,581
Really?

300
00:30:14,957 --> 00:30:17,125
Oh, that's perfect.

301
00:30:17,417 --> 00:30:19,962
You were awesome
in all the school plays.

302
00:30:20,295 --> 00:30:22,130
- Really?
- Yeah.

303
00:30:22,756 --> 00:30:25,759
I cried like a baby
when you played Cinderella.

304
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,470
Peter, that was first grade.

305
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:30,472
Well...

306
00:30:31,014 --> 00:30:32,516
...even so.

307
00:30:33,517 --> 00:30:35,435
Sometimes...

308
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,938
...you know people.

309
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:42,693
You can just see what's coming.

310
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,532
What do you see coming for you?

311
00:30:51,118 --> 00:30:52,786
I don't know.

312
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:59,793
Whatever it is, it's something
I never felt before.

313
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:06,300
And what for me?

314
00:31:06,466 --> 00:31:07,801
For you?

315
00:31:09,219 --> 00:31:11,972
You're gonna light up Broadway.

316
00:31:13,473 --> 00:31:14,808
You know...

317
00:31:19,187 --> 00:31:21,815
...you're taller than you look.

318
00:31:21,982 --> 00:31:23,525
I hunch.

319
00:31:25,777 --> 00:31:27,279
Don't.

320
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:34,369
Hey, M.J.! Come take a ride
in my new birthday present.

321
00:31:35,454 --> 00:31:36,747
Come on.

322
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:39,166
I gotta go.

323
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,168
Bye.

324
00:31:41,835 --> 00:31:44,504
- Oh, my God, it's gorgeous!
- Yeah, right.

325
00:31:44,671 --> 00:31:46,673
- Look at it!
- Hop in.

326
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:49,092
Oh, my God. What a cool car!

327
00:31:49,343 --> 00:31:50,927
Pretty tight, huh?

328
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:55,682
Wait till you hear the sound system.
Hey, don't scratch the leather.

329
00:31:57,434 --> 00:31:58,685
Cool car.

330
00:33:31,403 --> 00:33:33,447
What's going on in there?

331
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:36,283
I'm exercising.
I'm not dressed, Aunt May.

332
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,120
Well, you're acting
so strangely, Peter.

333
00:33:40,412 --> 00:33:42,497
Okay. Thanks.

334
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,657
Something's wrong.
Maybe he's too embarrassed to tell me.

335
00:34:16,823 --> 00:34:19,493
Maybe I'm too embarrassed to ask him.

336
00:34:20,285 --> 00:34:22,329
I just don't know anymore.

337
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:25,290
I'm going to the library.
See you later.

338
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,877
- Wait. I'll drive you there.
- I'll take the train.

339
00:34:29,044 --> 00:34:32,297
No, I need the exercise.
Go on. Go, go.

340
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:46,812
- Thanks for the ride, Uncle Ben.
- Wait. We need to talk.

341
00:34:46,979 --> 00:34:51,358
- We can talk later.
- Well, we can talk now. If you let me.

342
00:34:52,234 --> 00:34:54,486
What do we have to talk about?
Why now?

343
00:34:54,653 --> 00:34:58,699
We haven't talked for so long.
May and I don't know who you are.

344
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:03,870
You shirk your chores. You have all
those weird experiments in your room.

345
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:08,166
- You start fights at school.
- I told you I didn't start that fight.

346
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:11,336
- You sure finished it.
- Was I supposed to run away?

347
00:35:11,545 --> 00:35:14,548
No, you're not supposed
to run away, but...

348
00:35:14,715 --> 00:35:19,261
You're changing. I went through
exactly the same thing at your age.

349
00:35:19,469 --> 00:35:21,471
No. Not exactly.

350
00:35:22,848 --> 00:35:25,559
These are the years
when a man changes...

351
00:35:25,726 --> 00:35:29,730
...into the man he's gonna become
the rest of his life.

352
00:35:29,896 --> 00:35:32,983
Just be careful who you change into.

353
00:35:34,526 --> 00:35:39,031
This guy, Flash Thompson,
he probably deserved what happened.

354
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:42,284
But just because you can
beat him up...

355
00:35:42,743 --> 00:35:44,995
...doesn't give you the right to.

356
00:35:45,662 --> 00:35:50,917
Remember, with great power
comes great responsibility.

357
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:56,506
Are you afraid I'll become a criminal?
Quit worrying about me, okay?

358
00:35:56,673 --> 00:36:00,093
Something's different.
I'll figure it out. Stop lecturing.

359
00:36:00,385 --> 00:36:04,598
I don't mean to lecture or preach.
And I know I'm not your father.

360
00:36:04,765 --> 00:36:07,601
Then stop pretending to be!

361
00:36:11,688 --> 00:36:12,940
Right.

362
00:36:15,901 --> 00:36:17,861
I'll pick you up here at 10.

363
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:54,940
Bone Saw! Bone Saw! Bone Saw!

364
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:03,699
- One, two, three. That's it!
- Who's the man?

365
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:10,038
Ladies and gentlemen...

366
00:37:10,205 --> 00:37:14,751
...give it up for Bone Saw McGraw.

367
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,508
For $3000...

368
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:25,304
...is there no one here man enough
to stay in the ring...

369
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:30,183
...for three minutes
with this titan of testosterone?

370
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,855
Who?

371
00:37:35,105 --> 00:37:36,982
I know who.

372
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,987
The Flying Dutchman!

373
00:37:42,321 --> 00:37:43,780
Next.

374
00:37:44,615 --> 00:37:47,909
There's no featherweight
division here. Next.

375
00:37:48,076 --> 00:37:49,911
No, no. Sign me up.

376
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:53,749
Okay. You understand the NYWL
is not responsible...

377
00:37:53,957 --> 00:37:58,128
...for any injury you may and probably
will sustain in said event?

378
00:37:58,337 --> 00:38:01,465
And you're participating
under your own free will?

379
00:38:01,632 --> 00:38:05,677
Down the hall to the ramp.
May God be with you. Next.

380
00:38:08,263 --> 00:38:10,515
Told you! Told you!

381
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:12,517
Winner!

382
00:38:12,726 --> 00:38:13,936
Next victim!

383
00:38:15,812 --> 00:38:18,690
Are you ready for more?

384
00:38:19,816 --> 00:38:23,403
Bone Saw is ready!

385
00:38:25,822 --> 00:38:30,494
Will the next victim please
enter the arena at this time?

386
00:38:30,702 --> 00:38:35,415
If he can withstand just three minutes
in the cage with Bone Saw McGraw...

387
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:40,045
...the sum of $3000 will be paid to...

388
00:38:40,921 --> 00:38:43,924
- What's your name, kid?
- The Human Spider.

389
00:38:44,508 --> 00:38:46,885
That's it? That's the best you got?

390
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:49,179
- Yeah.
- Oh, that sucks.

391
00:38:49,346 --> 00:38:53,850
The sum of $3000 will be paid to...

392
00:38:54,017 --> 00:38:57,271
...the terrifying, the deadly...

393
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:00,732
...the amazing Spider-Man!

394
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,737
- It's "The Human Spider."
- Get out there.

395
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:08,949
- No, he got my name wrong.
- Get out there, moron.

396
00:39:11,451 --> 00:39:13,996
Bone Saw will eat you up
and spit you out.

397
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:16,290
I hope you brought your mommy.

398
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:20,711
- We'll break you!
- You'll need someone to cry to.

399
00:39:21,253 --> 00:39:26,383
I'm gonna rip all eight of your
feeble legs off one by one.

400
00:39:26,883 --> 00:39:28,927
Oh, my God!

401
00:39:29,136 --> 00:39:30,762
Oh, my legs!

402
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:33,557
Oh, God. I can't feel my legs.

403
00:39:33,724 --> 00:39:35,726
Kill! Kill! Kill!

404
00:39:43,984 --> 00:39:45,485
Cage! Cage! Cage!

405
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:46,862
Cage!

406
00:39:56,204 --> 00:39:57,664
Hello? Guys?

407
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:03,670
Will the guards please lock
the cage doors at this time?

408
00:40:04,379 --> 00:40:08,675
This is some kind of mistake.
I didn't sign up for a cage match!

409
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:12,346
Unlock the thing! Take the chain off!

410
00:40:12,554 --> 00:40:14,348
Hey, freak show!

411
00:40:14,556 --> 00:40:17,184
You're going nowhere.

412
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:19,728
I got you for three minutes.

413
00:40:19,895 --> 00:40:22,189
Three minutes of playtime.

414
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:32,282
- What are you doing up there?
- Staying away from you.

415
00:40:32,491 --> 00:40:36,536
That's a cute outfit.
Did your husband give it to you?

416
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:43,752
Finish him off!

417
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:52,469
Smash him!

418
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:01,395
- Hit him!
- Harder!

419
00:41:03,397 --> 00:41:05,732
Kick his spider ass!

420
00:41:07,734 --> 00:41:08,902
Hit him!

421
00:41:22,332 --> 00:41:24,126
One, two, three!

422
00:41:24,334 --> 00:41:27,129
That's it! That's it!
Winner!

423
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:32,384
Ladies and gentlemen, give it up
for the new champion, Spider-Man!

424
00:41:49,776 --> 00:41:51,445
Now get out of here.

425
00:41:53,071 --> 00:41:55,907
A hundred bucks? The ad said 3000.

426
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,493
Well, check it again, webhead.

427
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:02,539
It said three grand for three minutes.
You pinned him in two.

428
00:42:02,748 --> 00:42:06,126
For that, I give you 100.
You're lucky to get that.

429
00:42:06,293 --> 00:42:07,669
I need that money.

430
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:11,214
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

431
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:22,643
- Hey, what the hell..?
- Put the money in the bag.

432
00:42:24,478 --> 00:42:25,812
Hurry up!

433
00:42:32,152 --> 00:42:34,237
Hey! He stole the gate!

434
00:42:34,404 --> 00:42:36,365
Stop that guy!

435
00:42:36,657 --> 00:42:39,201
Stop him! He's got my money!

436
00:42:39,409 --> 00:42:40,661
Thanks.

437
00:42:41,912 --> 00:42:44,289
What's wrong with you?
You let him go!

438
00:42:44,456 --> 00:42:46,708
Cut him off and call the cops!

439
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:50,921
You could've taken that guy apart.
Now he'll get away.

440
00:42:51,088 --> 00:42:54,466
I missed the part
where that's my problem.

441
00:43:12,859 --> 00:43:15,779
- You gotta get back.
- I can't see. What happened?

442
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,407
Old dude, man.

443
00:43:18,615 --> 00:43:22,786
Come on, folks. Keep moving, please.
Keep moving. Let's go!

444
00:43:22,953 --> 00:43:25,789
- What happened?
- Someone got hurt.

445
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:31,378
- Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Stay back.

446
00:43:31,878 --> 00:43:33,714
- Stay back!
- That's my uncle!

447
00:43:35,882 --> 00:43:38,510
- What happened?
- Carjacker. He's been shot.

448
00:43:38,635 --> 00:43:42,180
We just called the paramedics.
They're on their way.

449
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,765
Uncle Ben?

450
00:43:44,683 --> 00:43:46,184
Uncle Ben.

451
00:43:49,938 --> 00:43:51,273
Uncle Ben?

452
00:43:54,901 --> 00:43:56,403
Peter.

453
00:43:57,279 --> 00:43:59,072
I'm here, Uncle Ben.

454
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:05,912
Peter.

455
00:44:27,893 --> 00:44:30,938
They got the shooter.
He's headed south on Fifth.

456
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:35,859
We got three cars in pursuit.
All right, folks. Come on, move back.

457
00:47:12,975 --> 00:47:14,893
Get a unit to the rear!

458
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:19,481
I got the back!

459
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:33,745
Who's there?

460
00:48:00,022 --> 00:48:03,150
Don't hurt me. Give me a chance.
Give me a chance!

461
00:48:03,317 --> 00:48:07,821
What about my uncle?
Did you give him a chance? Did you?

462
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:09,489
Answer me!

463
00:48:12,826 --> 00:48:14,161
Stop that guy!

464
00:48:19,625 --> 00:48:21,335
Thanks.

465
00:48:31,219 --> 00:48:32,346
See you.

466
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:57,496
Freeze! We've got the place
completely surrounded.

467
00:49:39,997 --> 00:49:42,666
Oh, no. My God.

468
00:49:44,543 --> 00:49:48,255
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. No!

469
00:49:56,596 --> 00:49:59,558
- Good evening.
- General. Good to see you.

470
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,228
Our exoskeleton's got
real firepower, general.

471
00:50:03,395 --> 00:50:08,817
Well, if it does what you say it can,
I'll sign that contract tomorrow.

472
00:50:09,526 --> 00:50:13,071
- He's clear! Go!
- You're confident about this test?

473
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:15,532
Absolutely. Curtis is our top pilot.

474
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:19,036
Now, what about
your commitment to OSCORP?

475
00:50:19,202 --> 00:50:23,123
Nothing would please me more
than to put Osborn out of business.

476
00:50:25,459 --> 00:50:28,503
Preflight complete. Mark.

477
00:50:32,633 --> 00:50:35,260
An unidentified object
is closing fast.

478
00:50:35,427 --> 00:50:36,511
What's that?

479
00:50:36,678 --> 00:50:38,180
Can you see anything?

480
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,015
Oh, my God!

481
00:50:50,317 --> 00:50:53,153
- Say "chess."
- Chess!

482
00:50:53,654 --> 00:50:55,530
Peter!

483
00:50:55,739 --> 00:51:00,285
Darling, I'm so proud of you.
You looked so handsome up there.

484
00:51:00,452 --> 00:51:03,956
Dad got the place in New York,
so we're all set for fall.

485
00:51:04,122 --> 00:51:05,666
- Great!
- You made it.

486
00:51:08,418 --> 00:51:11,755
It's not the first time
I've been proven wrong.

487
00:51:13,173 --> 00:51:15,342
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Dad.

488
00:51:15,759 --> 00:51:18,345
Peter, the science award.
That's terrific.

489
00:51:18,762 --> 00:51:20,055
Yeah.

490
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:26,395
I know this has been
a difficult time for you...

491
00:51:26,561 --> 00:51:29,815
...but I want you to try
to enjoy this day.

492
00:51:30,023 --> 00:51:31,566
Commencement:

493
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:35,862
The end of one thing,
the start of something new.

494
00:51:37,698 --> 00:51:41,368
I don't want to be with you anymore.
Here's your ring.

495
00:51:42,244 --> 00:51:44,121
You know what? Whatever.

496
00:51:44,663 --> 00:51:46,123
Your loss.

497
00:51:46,832 --> 00:51:50,377
You're like a brother to Harry.
That makes you family.

498
00:51:50,544 --> 00:51:54,381
And if you ever need anything,
give me a call.

499
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,522
Can I fix you something?

500
00:52:10,689 --> 00:52:12,190
No, thanks.

501
00:52:56,944 --> 00:52:59,154
I missed him a lot today.

502
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,241
I know.

503
00:53:04,993 --> 00:53:06,828
I miss him too.

504
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:10,916
But he was there.

505
00:53:14,086 --> 00:53:19,299
I can't help thinking about
the last thing I said to him.

506
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:24,513
He tried to tell me something important,
and I threw it in his face.

507
00:53:26,264 --> 00:53:28,350
You loved him...

508
00:53:30,018 --> 00:53:32,271
...and he loved you.

509
00:53:33,146 --> 00:53:36,817
He never doubted
the man you'd grow into.

510
00:53:36,984 --> 00:53:40,445
How you were meant for great things.

511
00:53:40,988 --> 00:53:43,323
You won't disappoint him.

512
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:21,028
With great power
comes great responsibility.

513
00:54:21,194 --> 00:54:24,406
Remember that, Pete. Remember that.

514
00:54:34,416 --> 00:54:35,667
Hurry up!

515
00:54:48,055 --> 00:54:51,808
He's not a man. My brother saw him
build a nest in Lincoln Center.

516
00:54:51,975 --> 00:54:55,187
I think he's human, a man.
Could be a woman.

517
00:54:59,274 --> 00:55:02,027
Bobby. Get a load of this!

518
00:55:05,197 --> 00:55:09,451
He throws up his hands,
ropes come out, and he climbs up them.

519
00:55:09,743 --> 00:55:13,872
I see the web, his signature,
and I know Spider-Man was here.

520
00:55:14,039 --> 00:55:16,667
The guy protects us,
protects the people.

521
00:55:16,833 --> 00:55:19,586
Some kind of freakyloo or something.

522
00:55:19,753 --> 00:55:21,797
He stinks and I don't like him.

523
00:55:22,506 --> 00:55:24,091
Don't move, lady!

524
00:55:32,182 --> 00:55:34,935
Guy with eight hands. Sounds hot.

525
00:55:35,143 --> 00:55:37,271
Those tights and that tight little...

526
00:55:37,437 --> 00:55:40,774
Dresses like a spider
He looks like a bug

527
00:55:40,983 --> 00:55:44,736
But we should all just give him
One big hug

528
00:55:44,945 --> 00:55:49,533
Look out
Here comes the Spider-Man

529
00:55:53,203 --> 00:55:56,957
"Who is Spider-Man?"
He's a criminal, that's who he is.

530
00:55:57,124 --> 00:56:01,128
A vigilante, a public menace.
Why's he on my front page?

531
00:56:01,169 --> 00:56:02,629
Mr. Jameson, your wife needs...

532
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,800
- There's a page six problem.
- We have a page one problem.

533
00:56:06,967 --> 00:56:08,510
- Well?
- He's news.

534
00:56:08,719 --> 00:56:11,221
- The clients can't wait.
- They're about to.

535
00:56:11,388 --> 00:56:15,392
- He pulled six people off a subway.
- From a wreck he probably caused.

536
00:56:15,559 --> 00:56:19,730
Something goes wrong and he's there.
Look! He's fleeing the scene.

537
00:56:19,896 --> 00:56:23,859
He's probably going to save
somebody else. He's a hero!

538
00:56:24,026 --> 00:56:26,820
Then why the mask?
What's he got to hide?

539
00:56:26,987 --> 00:56:30,032
She needs to know
if you want chintz or chenille.

540
00:56:30,198 --> 00:56:32,659
- Whichever's cheaper.
- It's like this:

541
00:56:32,826 --> 00:56:36,663
We double-booked page six.
Macy's and Conway's both have...

542
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:40,000
- We sold out four printings.
- Sold out?

543
00:56:40,167 --> 00:56:41,376
Every copy.

544
00:56:42,169 --> 00:56:45,756
Tomorrow, Spider-Man, page one.
Move Conway to page seven.

545
00:56:45,922 --> 00:56:48,842
- That's a problem.
- Then make it page eight.

546
00:56:49,009 --> 00:56:50,677
- That can't be done.
- Get out!

547
00:56:50,844 --> 00:56:55,724
We can't get a decent picture. Eddie's
on it, but we can barely see him.

548
00:56:55,891 --> 00:56:58,018
Aw, what is he, shy?

549
00:56:58,185 --> 00:57:02,189
If we can get Julia Roberts
in a thong, we can get this weirdo.

550
00:57:02,356 --> 00:57:05,776
On the front page:
"Cash for a Spider-Man picture."

551
00:57:05,943 --> 00:57:09,404
He doesn't want to be famous?
I'll make him infamous!

552
00:57:21,875 --> 00:57:23,293
Buzz off.

553
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:26,964
- M.J., it's me, Peter.
- Hi!

554
00:57:28,674 --> 00:57:33,553
- What are you doing around here?
- Begging for a job. How about you?

555
00:57:34,054 --> 00:57:37,766
- I'm headed to an audition.
- An audition? So you're acting?

556
00:57:37,933 --> 00:57:38,976
Yeah.

557
00:57:39,184 --> 00:57:43,063
I work steady.
In fact, I just got off a job.

558
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:44,398
That's great.

559
00:57:44,982 --> 00:57:48,193
- You're doing it. Living your dream.
- Glamour girl!

560
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:49,987
Your drawer was short $6!

561
00:57:50,153 --> 00:57:52,781
Next time, I'll take it
from your check.

562
00:57:53,865 --> 00:57:57,661
Excuse me, Miss Watson?
I'm talking to you! Hey!

563
00:57:57,869 --> 00:58:00,163
Yes, Enrique! Okay? I get you.

564
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:04,459
It better not happen no more.
Don't roll your eyes at me.

565
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:13,135
Some dream, huh?

566
00:58:14,011 --> 00:58:16,638
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

567
00:58:16,805 --> 00:58:19,599
- Don't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry?

568
00:58:20,017 --> 00:58:24,605
Don't you guys live together?
We're going out. Didn't he tell you?

569
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:26,607
Oh, yeah. Right.

570
00:58:26,857 --> 00:58:29,943
I think he'd hate the idea
of my waiting tables.

571
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:34,531
- He'd think it was low or something.
- It's not low. You have a job.

572
00:58:34,865 --> 00:58:39,202
You know, Harry doesn't live on
a little place I like to call Earth.

573
00:58:40,704 --> 00:58:42,623
No, I guess not.

574
00:58:47,628 --> 00:58:49,212
Thanks, Pete.

575
00:58:50,631 --> 00:58:52,549
We should catch up sometime.

576
00:58:56,762 --> 00:58:59,306
Let's get some lunch some evening.

577
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:05,062
I'll come by and have some of your
Moondance coffee some day.

578
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,981
- And I won't tell Harry.
- Don't tell Harry.

579
00:59:08,148 --> 00:59:09,399
I won't.

580
00:59:11,568 --> 00:59:13,320
I won't tell Harry.

581
00:59:24,623 --> 00:59:27,084
Timing's perfect. Hey.

582
00:59:27,292 --> 00:59:30,587
Five new contracts. It'll be great.

583
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:35,425
Norman's making his weekly inspection.

584
00:59:36,218 --> 00:59:38,470
Spent half of it on the phone.

585
00:59:39,054 --> 00:59:43,767
Look, man, I'm glad you're here.
I need your help. I'm really lost here.

586
00:59:44,601 --> 00:59:45,894
Are you all right?

587
00:59:47,229 --> 00:59:51,775
You look like you just got
second place in the science fair.

588
00:59:53,068 --> 00:59:56,029
I was late for work
and Dr. Connors fired me.

589
00:59:56,196 --> 00:59:57,739
You were late again?

590
00:59:58,365 --> 01:00:02,327
I don't get it.
Where do you go all the time?

591
01:00:02,494 --> 01:00:03,745
Around.

592
01:00:03,912 --> 01:00:05,622
Peter Parker.

593
01:00:05,956 --> 01:00:08,458
- Maybe you'll tell me who she is.
- Who?

594
01:00:08,625 --> 01:00:11,712
- This mystery girl Harry's been dating.
- Dad.

595
01:00:12,087 --> 01:00:13,755
When do I get to meet her?

596
01:00:13,922 --> 01:00:17,217
Well, sorry.
Harry hasn't mentioned her.

597
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:23,348
Pete, you're probably looking
for a job now, right?

598
01:00:23,557 --> 01:00:26,393
Dad, maybe you can help him out.

599
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,897
- I appreciate it, but I'll be fine.
- I'll make a few calls.

600
01:00:31,064 --> 01:00:35,360
I couldn't accept it. I like to earn
what I get. I'll find work.

601
01:00:35,569 --> 01:00:37,195
I respect that.

602
01:00:37,904 --> 01:00:40,032
You want to make it on your own.

603
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:42,034
That's great.

604
01:00:42,909 --> 01:00:45,245
What other skills do you have?

605
01:00:45,454 --> 01:00:47,581
I was thinking about photography.

606
01:00:50,542 --> 01:00:51,793
Hello.

607
01:00:53,712 --> 01:00:56,006
Let's go! Move it!

608
01:00:57,174 --> 01:00:58,842
Watch the street!

609
01:01:14,274 --> 01:01:15,651
Cheese!

610
01:01:24,576 --> 01:01:25,869
They're crap.

611
01:01:26,078 --> 01:01:29,039
Crap, crap. Megacrap.

612
01:01:29,247 --> 01:01:32,417
- I'll give you $200.
- That seems a little low.

613
01:01:32,626 --> 01:01:34,378
Take them somewhere else.

614
01:01:34,795 --> 01:01:38,882
- Your wife says the tile's out of stock.
- We'll put a rug there.

615
01:01:39,257 --> 01:01:41,218
Sit down. Give me that.

616
01:01:42,803 --> 01:01:45,347
Give you 300.
That's the standard fee.

617
01:01:45,514 --> 01:01:47,849
- Scrap page one. Run that.
- Headline?

618
01:01:48,141 --> 01:01:51,353
"Spider-Man, Hero or Menace?
Exclusive Photos."

619
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:54,648
- Menace? He was protecting...
- You take the photos...

620
01:01:54,856 --> 01:01:57,526
...I'll make up the headlines. Okay?

621
01:01:57,693 --> 01:01:59,695
- Yes, sir.
- Goody.

622
01:02:00,153 --> 01:02:03,657
Give this to the girl up front.
She'll see you get paid.

623
01:02:04,116 --> 01:02:06,910
- I'd like a job, sir.
- No jobs. Freelance.

624
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,745
Best thing for you.

625
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:13,250
You bring me more shots of that clown,
maybe I'll buy them.

626
01:02:13,458 --> 01:02:16,420
But I never said you have a job. Meat.

627
01:02:16,586 --> 01:02:20,882
I'll send you a box of Christmas
meat. Bring me more photos.

628
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:23,677
- Hi.
- Hi.

629
01:02:23,885 --> 01:02:27,306
Mr. Jameson told me
to give that to you.

630
01:02:28,390 --> 01:02:31,518
- Welcome to the Daily Bugle.
- Thank you.

631
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,437
I'm Peter Parker.

632
01:02:35,939 --> 01:02:38,108
I'm a photographer.

633
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:41,445
Yes. I can see that.

634
01:02:49,161 --> 01:02:50,996
As of today...

635
01:02:51,163 --> 01:02:55,167
...OSCORP Industries has surpassed
Quest Aerospace...

636
01:02:55,417 --> 01:02:59,838
...as the principal supplier
to the United States military.

637
01:03:00,005 --> 01:03:02,841
In short, ladies and gentlemen
of the board...

638
01:03:03,008 --> 01:03:06,178
...costs are down, revenues are up...

639
01:03:06,428 --> 01:03:09,264
...and our stock
has never been higher.

640
01:03:09,431 --> 01:03:13,852
Wonderful news, Norman.
That's why we're selling the company.

641
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:15,938
What?

642
01:03:16,146 --> 01:03:21,276
Quest is recapitalizing in the wake
of the bombing. Expanding.

643
01:03:21,526 --> 01:03:24,279
They made a tender offer
we can't ignore.

644
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:25,614
Why wasn't I told?

645
01:03:25,781 --> 01:03:29,868
They don't want a power struggle
with entrenched management.

646
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,454
The deal is off if you come with it.

647
01:03:32,621 --> 01:03:36,041
The board expects your resignation
in 30 days.

648
01:03:36,249 --> 01:03:38,210
You can't do this to me.

649
01:03:41,380 --> 01:03:43,674
I started this company.

650
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:47,135
You know how much I sacrificed?!

651
01:03:50,973 --> 01:03:56,436
- Oh, Max. Please.
- Norman, the board is unanimous.

652
01:03:56,979 --> 01:04:00,983
We're announcing the sale
after the World Unity Festival.

653
01:04:01,149 --> 01:04:02,651
I'm sorry.

654
01:04:03,652 --> 01:04:05,779
You're out, Norman.

655
01:04:15,664 --> 01:04:17,165
Am I?

656
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:27,884
Let's hear it for Macy Gray.

657
01:05:04,296 --> 01:05:07,841
M.J., why didn't you wear
the black dress?

658
01:05:08,884 --> 01:05:12,554
Just, I wanted to impress my father.
He loves black.

659
01:05:12,721 --> 01:05:17,267
Well, maybe he'll be impressed
no matter what. You think I'm pretty.

660
01:05:17,809 --> 01:05:20,187
I think you're beautiful.

661
01:05:32,991 --> 01:05:36,244
I forgot my drink inside.

662
01:05:46,463 --> 01:05:48,590
- Oh, hi, Mr. Fargas.
- Oh, Harry.

663
01:05:49,675 --> 01:05:54,846
- Have you seen my father?
- Well, I'm not sure if he's coming.

664
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:09,361
- What is that?
- Must be new this year.

665
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:15,534
What is that?

666
01:06:15,701 --> 01:06:17,619
That's our glider!

667
01:06:28,005 --> 01:06:29,464
What the hell was that?

668
01:06:57,868 --> 01:06:59,286
Code three!

669
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:17,471
- Oh, my God! Harry!
- M.J.!

670
01:07:23,435 --> 01:07:26,897
Harry! Help me! Harry!

671
01:07:32,861 --> 01:07:34,613
Out, am I?

672
01:07:39,159 --> 01:07:42,371
- Mary Jane!
- Harry!

673
01:07:44,373 --> 01:07:46,249
Hello, my dear.

674
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:49,086
It's Spider-Man!

675
01:08:00,597 --> 01:08:02,557
- Come on. Move, kid.
- Billy!

676
01:08:06,061 --> 01:08:08,397
Somebody help him!

677
01:08:08,605 --> 01:08:10,649
No!

678
01:08:11,650 --> 01:08:13,193
Mommy!

679
01:08:15,195 --> 01:08:17,155
- Hold it!
- I surrender.

680
01:08:17,739 --> 01:08:20,242
- Oh, boy.
- Hold it right there!

681
01:08:26,039 --> 01:08:27,291
Impressive.

682
01:08:51,565 --> 01:08:55,027
- Mary Jane!
- Help! Someone please help me!

683
01:09:20,385 --> 01:09:21,428
Hold on!

684
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:24,097
Watch out!

685
01:09:33,231 --> 01:09:37,027
We'll meet again, Spider-Man!

686
01:10:22,531 --> 01:10:25,200
Well, beats taking the subway.

687
01:10:25,409 --> 01:10:28,662
Don't mind us.
She just needs to use the elevator.

688
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:29,955
Wait.

689
01:10:30,122 --> 01:10:31,373
Who are you?

690
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,126
- You know who I am.
- I do?

691
01:10:34,334 --> 01:10:36,962
Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

692
01:10:48,682 --> 01:10:52,561
Incredible?
What do you mean he's incredible?

693
01:10:53,729 --> 01:10:57,399
No. All right, wait.
Stay there. I'll come over.

694
01:10:58,066 --> 01:10:59,735
No, I'm gonna come...

695
01:11:00,068 --> 01:11:03,488
All right. Fine.
Will you call me in the morning?

696
01:11:03,697 --> 01:11:06,658
And we'll go and have breakfast and...

697
01:11:06,825 --> 01:11:09,119
...I want to buy you something.

698
01:11:09,286 --> 01:11:12,623
Because I want to.
It'll make you feel better.

699
01:11:13,665 --> 01:11:17,336
Okay. And what do you mean,
incredible?

700
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:22,549
All right. I'm sorry. Sleep tight.

701
01:11:22,716 --> 01:11:24,468
Don't let the bedbugs...

702
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:33,185
She's all right.
She's just a little rattled.

703
01:11:34,895 --> 01:11:38,523
Look, Pete, I should have
told you about us.

704
01:11:39,858 --> 01:11:42,527
But you should know
I'm crazy about her.

705
01:11:42,694 --> 01:11:45,739
It's just, you know,
you never made a move.

706
01:11:46,823 --> 01:11:48,325
You're right.

707
01:11:49,242 --> 01:11:50,744
I didn't.

708
01:11:54,748 --> 01:11:57,167
I'm gonna get some rest.

709
01:11:58,418 --> 01:12:00,671
I'm gonna stay up for a while.

710
01:12:01,755 --> 01:12:03,507
What was that thing?

711
01:12:04,091 --> 01:12:05,425
I don't know.

712
01:12:06,843 --> 01:12:10,222
Whatever it is,
somebody has to stop it.

713
01:12:26,113 --> 01:12:27,281
Somebody there?

714
01:12:27,281 --> 01:12:30,075
Somebody.

715
01:12:31,410 --> 01:12:32,953
Who said that?

716
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:36,957
Don't play the innocent with me.

717
01:12:39,418 --> 01:12:42,087
You've known all along.

718
01:12:46,091 --> 01:12:47,467
Where are you?

719
01:12:47,634 --> 01:12:51,680
Follow the cold shiver
running down your spine.

720
01:12:58,562 --> 01:13:00,397
I'm right here.

721
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:04,151
I don't understand.

722
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:08,322
Did you think it was coincidence?

723
01:13:08,572 --> 01:13:12,117
So many good things,
all happening for you.

724
01:13:12,284 --> 01:13:15,954
All for you. Norman.

725
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:19,916
What do you want?

726
01:13:20,459 --> 01:13:22,502
To say what you won't.

727
01:13:22,794 --> 01:13:25,339
To do what you can't.

728
01:13:25,505 --> 01:13:30,093
To remove those in your way.

729
01:13:34,056 --> 01:13:36,016
The board members.

730
01:13:37,309 --> 01:13:38,685
You killed them.

731
01:13:38,852 --> 01:13:40,395
We killed them.

732
01:13:40,729 --> 01:13:41,772
We?

733
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,523
Remember?

734
01:13:43,690 --> 01:13:46,360
Your little accident
in the laboratory.

735
01:13:48,236 --> 01:13:50,030
The performance enhancers.

736
01:13:50,197 --> 01:13:55,494
Bingo. Me!
Your greatest creation.

737
01:13:55,702 --> 01:13:59,498
Bringing you
what you've always wanted:

738
01:13:59,665 --> 01:14:02,542
Power beyond your wildest dreams.

739
01:14:02,709 --> 01:14:05,212
And it's only the beginning.

740
01:14:06,713 --> 01:14:11,051
There's only one who can stop us.

741
01:14:11,843 --> 01:14:15,222
Or imagine if he joined us.

742
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:23,230
Spider-Man. And the Green Goblin.

743
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,733
The Green Goblin. You like that?
Made it up myself.

744
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:29,903
- These weirdos all got to have a name.
- Mr. Jameson...

745
01:14:30,070 --> 01:14:31,738
- Hoffman!
- Yeah?

746
01:14:32,948 --> 01:14:36,702
Copyright "Green Goblin."
I want a quarter every time it's said.

747
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:39,204
How about "Green Meanie"?

748
01:14:39,371 --> 01:14:42,249
Spider-Man wasn't attacking.
That's slander.

749
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:44,751
It is not. I resent that.

750
01:14:45,002 --> 01:14:47,754
Slander is spoken.
In print, it's libel.

751
01:14:47,921 --> 01:14:49,589
You don't trust anybody.

752
01:14:50,048 --> 01:14:51,800
I trust my barber.

753
01:14:52,634 --> 01:14:54,136
Are you his lawyer?

754
01:14:54,344 --> 01:14:59,099
Let him sue. Get rich like a normal
person. That's what made this country...

755
01:15:06,607 --> 01:15:09,735
Jameson, you slime.

756
01:15:09,943 --> 01:15:13,238
Who takes the pictures of Spider-Man?

757
01:15:13,447 --> 01:15:16,366
- I don't know. His stuff comes by mail.
- Liar!

758
01:15:16,533 --> 01:15:19,536
- I swear.
- He's the one who can bring me to him.

759
01:15:19,703 --> 01:15:22,623
- I don't know who he is.
- You are useless.

760
01:15:22,831 --> 01:15:25,083
Set him down, tough guy.

761
01:15:25,334 --> 01:15:29,921
- Speak of the devil.
- I knew you two were in this together!

762
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:32,716
Kiddo, let Mom and Dad
talk for a minute.

763
01:15:32,924 --> 01:15:35,385
Sleep...

764
01:15:49,858 --> 01:15:53,862
Wake up, little spider. Wake up.

765
01:15:54,029 --> 01:15:58,450
No, you're not dead yet.

766
01:15:58,659 --> 01:16:00,827
Just paralyzed...

767
01:16:00,994 --> 01:16:02,955
...temporarily.

768
01:16:03,956 --> 01:16:07,042
You're an amazing creature,
Spider-Man.

769
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:09,920
You and I are not so different.

770
01:16:10,629 --> 01:16:13,966
I'm not like you. You're a murderer.

771
01:16:14,174 --> 01:16:17,052
Well, to each his own.

772
01:16:17,219 --> 01:16:20,180
I chose my path,
you chose the way of the hero.

773
01:16:20,847 --> 01:16:25,477
And they found you amusing
for a while, the people of this city.

774
01:16:25,686 --> 01:16:28,939
But the one thing they love
more than a hero...

775
01:16:29,147 --> 01:16:32,734
...is to see a hero fail,
fall, die trying.

776
01:16:32,901 --> 01:16:37,447
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

777
01:16:37,656 --> 01:16:38,699
Why bother?

778
01:16:38,907 --> 01:16:43,620
- Because it's right.
- Here's the real truth.

779
01:16:44,037 --> 01:16:47,040
There are eight million people
in this city.

780
01:16:47,249 --> 01:16:51,545
And those teeming masses exist
for the sole purpose...

781
01:16:51,753 --> 01:16:55,716
...of lifting the few exceptional
people onto their shoulders.

782
01:16:55,882 --> 01:16:57,301
You, me...

783
01:16:57,884 --> 01:16:59,803
...we're exceptional.

784
01:17:00,053 --> 01:17:04,725
I could squash you like a bug
right now.

785
01:17:04,933 --> 01:17:08,604
But I'm offering you a choice.
Join me.

786
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:12,357
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

787
01:17:12,566 --> 01:17:15,319
What we could create.

788
01:17:15,902 --> 01:17:17,904
Or we could destroy.

789
01:17:18,071 --> 01:17:22,034
Cause the deaths of countless
innocents in selfish battle...

790
01:17:22,242 --> 01:17:27,122
...again and again and again until
we're both dead. Is that what you want?

791
01:17:29,124 --> 01:17:32,002
Think about it, hero.

792
01:17:43,972 --> 01:17:49,311
In spite of everything you've done for
them, eventually, they will hate you.

793
01:17:59,655 --> 01:18:01,114
It's me again.

794
01:18:01,490 --> 01:18:02,908
How was your audition?

795
01:18:03,116 --> 01:18:06,119
- How'd you know?
- The hot line. Your mom...

796
01:18:06,286 --> 01:18:08,246
...told my aunt, told me.

797
01:18:08,705 --> 01:18:10,040
So you just came by?

798
01:18:10,248 --> 01:18:13,877
I was in the neighborhood.
Needed to see a friendly face.

799
01:18:14,044 --> 01:18:18,632
I took two buses and a cab
to get in the neighborhood, but...

800
01:18:18,882 --> 01:18:20,384
So how'd it go?

801
01:18:22,552 --> 01:18:25,138
They said I needed acting lessons.

802
01:18:25,305 --> 01:18:29,059
A soap opera told me
I needed acting lessons.

803
01:18:29,226 --> 01:18:34,564
Let me buy you a cheeseburger.
The sky's the limit, up to $7.84.

804
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:37,985
I'd like a cheeseburger.

805
01:18:38,443 --> 01:18:41,905
Oh, but I'm going out to dinner
with Harry.

806
01:18:42,322 --> 01:18:43,740
Come with us.

807
01:18:43,907 --> 01:18:46,660
No, thanks. How's it going with?

808
01:18:48,578 --> 01:18:51,081
Never mind.
That's none of my business.

809
01:18:51,581 --> 01:18:53,083
It's not?

810
01:18:54,501 --> 01:18:56,169
Why so interested?

811
01:18:56,837 --> 01:18:58,338
I'm not.

812
01:18:58,588 --> 01:18:59,965
You're not?

813
01:19:01,591 --> 01:19:04,344
- Well, why would I be?
- I don't know.

814
01:19:04,594 --> 01:19:06,388
Why would you be?

815
01:19:08,265 --> 01:19:10,601
I, that's a...

816
01:19:10,809 --> 01:19:12,311
I don't know.

817
01:19:14,521 --> 01:19:17,357
Sorry you won't come with us.

818
01:19:19,818 --> 01:19:21,778
I'd better run, tiger.

819
01:19:30,495 --> 01:19:32,497
Hey, check it out, man.

820
01:19:32,664 --> 01:19:34,333
Come on, man.

821
01:19:37,878 --> 01:19:41,131
Hey, where you going, baby?
Come on!

822
01:19:59,024 --> 01:20:00,484
Get off me!

823
01:20:33,767 --> 01:20:35,269
Wait!

824
01:20:40,107 --> 01:20:42,484
You have a knack
for getting in trouble.

825
01:20:42,651 --> 01:20:47,030
You have a knack for saving my life.
I think I have a superhero stalker.

826
01:20:47,239 --> 01:20:49,116
I was in the neighborhood.

827
01:20:50,993 --> 01:20:53,620
You are amazing.

828
01:20:54,579 --> 01:20:57,291
Some people don't think so.

829
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:01,378
- But you are.
- Nice to have a fan.

830
01:21:02,129 --> 01:21:05,340
Do I get to say thank you this time?

831
01:21:06,216 --> 01:21:07,718
Wait.

832
01:22:16,703 --> 01:22:18,830
Let me in! My baby's in there!

833
01:22:18,997 --> 01:22:21,124
- Let me go!
- The roof's collapsing!

834
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:24,795
- Somebody save my baby!
- The roof's about to collapse!

835
01:22:25,003 --> 01:22:26,338
Look! Up there!

836
01:22:32,928 --> 01:22:34,763
Save my baby, please!

837
01:22:58,495 --> 01:22:59,621
No!

838
01:23:07,379 --> 01:23:11,383
- It's okay. Your baby's fine.
- Oh, my baby!

839
01:23:12,426 --> 01:23:15,345
God bless you, Spider-Man.
Bless you.

840
01:23:15,554 --> 01:23:17,306
Don't let him get away!

841
01:23:17,514 --> 01:23:20,767
Hold it! You're under arrest.
I'm taking you in.

842
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:24,271
Oh, my God, there's somebody
still up there!

843
01:23:25,731 --> 01:23:27,065
I'm going.

844
01:23:28,734 --> 01:23:31,778
- I'll be here when you get back.
- Not coming back.

845
01:23:32,195 --> 01:23:33,322
Go! Go!

846
01:23:42,247 --> 01:23:43,957
Where are you?

847
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:47,586
Where are you?

848
01:23:52,966 --> 01:23:55,344
I'm gonna get you out of here!

849
01:23:57,929 --> 01:23:59,431
It's okay.

850
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,066
You're pathetically predictable.

851
01:24:09,232 --> 01:24:11,151
Like a moth to the flame.

852
01:24:12,027 --> 01:24:14,488
What about my generous proposal?

853
01:24:15,530 --> 01:24:18,367
Are you in or are you out?

854
01:24:18,575 --> 01:24:24,498
- It's you who's out. Out of your mind.
- Wrong answer.

855
01:24:24,915 --> 01:24:26,416
Oh, great.

856
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:07,874
No one says no to me!

857
01:25:15,215 --> 01:25:18,635
- M.J., will you stop goofing around?
- Harry, relax.

858
01:25:21,138 --> 01:25:22,389
He's here.

859
01:25:23,181 --> 01:25:24,683
Are you ready?

860
01:25:26,518 --> 01:25:29,187
Aunt May. I'm sorry I'm late.

861
01:25:29,396 --> 01:25:32,482
Work was murder.
I picked up a fruitcake.

862
01:25:32,691 --> 01:25:36,111
Thank you, Mr. Osborn.
We're so glad you could come.

863
01:25:36,361 --> 01:25:39,072
Who is this lovely young lady?

864
01:25:39,239 --> 01:25:43,535
I'd like you to meet my father.
Dad, this is Mary Jane Watson.

865
01:25:43,744 --> 01:25:46,413
I've been looking forward
to meeting you.

866
01:25:46,622 --> 01:25:50,334
- Happy Thanksgiving, sir.
- Now, where is Peter?

867
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:52,878
He'd better remember
that cranberry sauce.

868
01:25:58,634 --> 01:26:02,220
Oh, that's weird.
I didn't know he was here.

869
01:26:05,223 --> 01:26:06,725
Peter?

870
01:26:14,775 --> 01:26:16,485
Is that you?

871
01:26:21,949 --> 01:26:26,119
How strange. There's nobody here.

872
01:26:32,584 --> 01:26:37,047
- Bit of a slob, isn't he?
- All brilliant men are.

873
01:27:09,663 --> 01:27:12,291
- Hey, everyone.
- Oh, Peter!

874
01:27:12,457 --> 01:27:14,209
It's a jungle out there.

875
01:27:14,376 --> 01:27:18,297
Had to beat an old lady with a stick
to get these cranberries.

876
01:27:18,755 --> 01:27:21,591
Thank you.
Now then, everybody sit down...

877
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:23,343
...and we can say grace.

878
01:27:26,888 --> 01:27:28,640
Here we go.

879
01:27:35,606 --> 01:27:37,941
- There we are.
- It looks delicious.

880
01:27:41,737 --> 01:27:44,031
Will you do the honors?

881
01:27:55,709 --> 01:27:58,962
Why, Peter, you're bleeding.

882
01:28:01,798 --> 01:28:07,137
I stepped off a curb and got clipped
by one of those bike messengers.

883
01:28:07,304 --> 01:28:08,847
Well, let me see.

884
01:28:09,056 --> 01:28:10,557
Oh, my goodness.

885
01:28:10,807 --> 01:28:13,226
- That looks awful.
- No, it's nothing.

886
01:28:13,393 --> 01:28:16,521
I'll get the first-aid kit.
Then we'll say grace.

887
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:22,027
This is the boys' first Thanksgiving
here, and we'll do things properly.

888
01:28:22,986 --> 01:28:26,073
How did you say that happened?

889
01:28:26,490 --> 01:28:28,200
Bike messenger.

890
01:28:28,408 --> 01:28:30,369
Knocked me down.

891
01:28:35,749 --> 01:28:39,419
- If you'll excuse me, I've got to go.
- Why?

892
01:28:40,337 --> 01:28:43,715
Something has come to my attention.

893
01:28:43,924 --> 01:28:45,175
Are you all right?

894
01:28:45,384 --> 01:28:48,887
I'm fine, just fine.
Thank you, Mrs. Parker. Everyone.

895
01:28:49,513 --> 01:28:51,890
- Enjoy the fruitcake.
- Dad!

896
01:28:54,059 --> 01:28:57,854
I planned this so you'd meet M.J.,
and now you have to leave?

897
01:28:58,063 --> 01:28:59,731
I've got to go.

898
01:29:00,065 --> 01:29:04,194
- This girl is important to me.
- Harry, please. Look at her.

899
01:29:04,403 --> 01:29:08,365
Think she's sniffing around
because she likes your personality?

900
01:29:08,615 --> 01:29:11,618
- What are you saying?
- Your mother was beautiful.

901
01:29:11,785 --> 01:29:17,207
They're all beautiful until they're
snarling after your money like wolves.

902
01:29:17,416 --> 01:29:18,667
You're wrong, Dad.

903
01:29:19,209 --> 01:29:22,421
A word to the not-so-wise
about your girlfriend:

904
01:29:22,587 --> 01:29:26,466
Do what you need to with her,
then broom her fast.

905
01:29:36,852 --> 01:29:39,396
Thanks for sticking up for me, Harry.

906
01:29:39,605 --> 01:29:42,566
- You heard?
- Everyone heard that creep.

907
01:29:42,774 --> 01:29:46,653
That creep is my father.
With luck, I'll be half of what he is.

908
01:29:46,903 --> 01:29:49,239
Shut up about stuff
you don't understand!

909
01:29:49,406 --> 01:29:51,074
Harry Osborn!

910
01:29:52,159 --> 01:29:54,202
I'm sorry, Aunt May.

911
01:29:57,164 --> 01:30:00,500
Spider-Man is all but invincible.

912
01:30:00,667 --> 01:30:03,795
But Parker, we can destroy him.

913
01:30:04,004 --> 01:30:05,339
I can't.

914
01:30:05,505 --> 01:30:08,508
Betrayal must not be countenanced.

915
01:30:08,759 --> 01:30:11,011
Parker must be educated.

916
01:30:13,180 --> 01:30:14,473
What do I do?

917
01:30:14,681 --> 01:30:18,769
Instruct him in the matters
of loss and pain.

918
01:30:18,936 --> 01:30:21,980
Make him suffer.
Make him wish he were dead.

919
01:30:22,230 --> 01:30:23,523
Yes?

920
01:30:23,690 --> 01:30:25,609
And then grant his wish.

921
01:30:26,526 --> 01:30:27,819
But how?

922
01:30:28,028 --> 01:30:32,324
The cunning warrior attacks
neither body nor mind.

923
01:30:32,532 --> 01:30:33,700
Tell me how!

924
01:30:33,867 --> 01:30:36,036
The heart, Osborn.

925
01:30:36,286 --> 01:30:39,331
First, we attack his heart.

926
01:30:41,208 --> 01:30:44,711
Give us this day our daily bread,
and forgive us our trespasses...

927
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,881
...as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

928
01:30:48,131 --> 01:30:51,969
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us...

929
01:30:59,726 --> 01:31:02,271
Deliver us!

930
01:31:02,479 --> 01:31:03,855
Finish it!

931
01:31:04,147 --> 01:31:08,068
- Finish it!
- From evil!

932
01:31:13,782 --> 01:31:15,951
Two milligrams IV.

933
01:31:17,744 --> 01:31:18,996
Get the BP.

934
01:31:19,413 --> 01:31:23,000
Aunt May. Is she gonna be okay?
What happened?

935
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:24,543
You have to leave.

936
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:26,420
- What happened?
- Those eyes!

937
01:31:26,586 --> 01:31:30,674
Those horrible yellow eyes!

938
01:31:35,512 --> 01:31:38,056
He knows who I am.

939
01:32:22,017 --> 01:32:23,602
I'm sorry.

940
01:32:27,314 --> 01:32:29,775
- Will she be okay?
- She'll be fine.

941
01:32:29,942 --> 01:32:32,611
She's been sleeping all day.

942
01:32:33,612 --> 01:32:36,365
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course.

943
01:32:40,535 --> 01:32:43,455
How are you?
You okay about the other night?

944
01:32:43,622 --> 01:32:47,334
Yeah, I'm fine. I just felt bad
about leaving Aunt May.

945
01:32:47,542 --> 01:32:50,504
- Have you talked to Harry?
- He called me.

946
01:32:50,963 --> 01:32:53,131
I haven't called him back.

947
01:32:55,217 --> 01:32:56,927
The fact is...

948
01:32:58,095 --> 01:33:00,931
...I'm in love with somebody else.
- You are?

949
01:33:01,098 --> 01:33:03,308
At least I think I am.

950
01:33:04,977 --> 01:33:08,021
- It's not the time to talk about it.
- No. Go on.

951
01:33:08,188 --> 01:33:11,441
Would I know his name, this guy?

952
01:33:11,650 --> 01:33:14,528
You'll think I'm a little girl
with a crush.

953
01:33:14,695 --> 01:33:16,071
Trust me.

954
01:33:16,321 --> 01:33:17,572
It's funny.

955
01:33:19,574 --> 01:33:23,537
He's saved my life twice,
and I've never even seen his face.

956
01:33:23,704 --> 01:33:27,082
- Oh. Him.
- You're laughing at me.

957
01:33:27,291 --> 01:33:30,252
No, I understand.
He is extremely cool.

958
01:33:30,460 --> 01:33:34,756
But do you think it's true,
all the terrible things they say?

959
01:33:34,923 --> 01:33:37,843
Not Spider-Man,
not a chance in the world.

960
01:33:38,051 --> 01:33:39,678
I know him a little bit.

961
01:33:39,886 --> 01:33:42,764
I'm sort of his unofficial
photographer.

962
01:33:42,973 --> 01:33:46,101
- Has he mentioned me?
- Yeah.

963
01:33:46,435 --> 01:33:47,894
What'd he say?

964
01:33:48,478 --> 01:33:49,813
I said...

965
01:33:50,897 --> 01:33:55,193
He asked me what I thought about you.

966
01:33:56,111 --> 01:33:58,155
And what did you say?

967
01:33:58,864 --> 01:34:02,951
I said, "Spider-Man."

968
01:34:03,285 --> 01:34:08,165
I said, "The great thing about M.J...

969
01:34:08,373 --> 01:34:09,916
...is...

970
01:34:10,834 --> 01:34:14,087
...when you look in her eyes...

971
01:34:16,632 --> 01:34:19,843
...and she's looking back in yours...

972
01:34:20,844 --> 01:34:23,847
...everything feels...

973
01:34:25,057 --> 01:34:26,892
...not quite normal.

974
01:34:28,143 --> 01:34:29,937
Because you feel...

975
01:34:30,479 --> 01:34:32,105
...stronger...

976
01:34:33,649 --> 01:34:37,277
...and weaker at the same time.

977
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,447
You feel excited...

978
01:34:41,323 --> 01:34:43,367
...and at the same time...

979
01:34:43,992 --> 01:34:45,619
...terrified.

980
01:34:47,955 --> 01:34:52,250
The truth is, you don't know
what you feel...

981
01:34:53,669 --> 01:34:57,297
...except you know what kind of man
you want to be.

982
01:35:00,008 --> 01:35:01,885
It's as if you've...

983
01:35:02,511 --> 01:35:05,681
...reached the unreachable...

984
01:35:07,265 --> 01:35:09,977
...and you weren't ready for it."

985
01:35:13,438 --> 01:35:15,190
You said that?

986
01:35:15,983 --> 01:35:18,318
Well, something like that.

987
01:36:02,613 --> 01:36:04,114
Dad?

988
01:36:09,453 --> 01:36:11,538
Dad, is that you?

989
01:36:18,128 --> 01:36:19,630
What is it?

990
01:36:21,882 --> 01:36:26,887
You were right about M.J.
You're right about everything.

991
01:36:27,888 --> 01:36:30,599
She's in love with Peter.

992
01:36:30,891 --> 01:36:32,684
- Parker?
- Yeah.

993
01:36:32,851 --> 01:36:35,979
And how does he feel about her?

994
01:36:37,397 --> 01:36:39,942
He's loved her since the 4th grade.

995
01:36:40,901 --> 01:36:46,156
He pretends like he doesn't, but
there's no one Peter cares for more.

996
01:36:49,076 --> 01:36:50,827
I'm so sorry.

997
01:36:53,288 --> 01:36:56,750
I haven't always been there for you,
have I?

998
01:36:58,502 --> 01:37:01,713
You're busy. You're an important man.
I understand.

999
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:03,715
That's no excuse.

1000
01:37:04,716 --> 01:37:06,510
I'm proud of you.

1001
01:37:07,052 --> 01:37:11,932
I've lost sight of that somewhere.
But I'll make it up to you.

1002
01:37:12,099 --> 01:37:15,352
I'm going to rectify
certain inequities.

1003
01:37:29,491 --> 01:37:31,285
Wake up, little spider.

1004
01:37:31,451 --> 01:37:32,953
Wake up.

1005
01:37:34,288 --> 01:37:35,872
Go home, dear.

1006
01:37:36,081 --> 01:37:37,416
You look awful.

1007
01:37:37,624 --> 01:37:39,918
- And you look beautiful.
- Thank you.

1008
01:37:40,085 --> 01:37:43,422
- I don't like to leave you here.
- But I'm safe here.

1009
01:37:43,588 --> 01:37:46,300
- Can I do anything for you?
- You do too much.

1010
01:37:46,466 --> 01:37:52,014
College, a job, all this time with me.
You're not Superman, you know.

1011
01:37:52,764 --> 01:37:54,516
A smile. Finally.

1012
01:37:54,683 --> 01:37:59,021
Haven't seen one of those on your face
since Mary Jane was here.

1013
01:37:59,187 --> 01:38:01,481
You were supposed to be asleep.

1014
01:38:02,316 --> 01:38:07,070
You know, you were about 6 years old
when M.J.'s family moved in next door.

1015
01:38:07,279 --> 01:38:11,283
When she got out of the car,
and you saw her for the first time...

1016
01:38:11,491 --> 01:38:17,748
...you grabbed me and said,
"Aunt May, is that an angel?"

1017
01:38:17,956 --> 01:38:21,501
- Gee, did I say that?
- You sure did.

1018
01:38:24,171 --> 01:38:26,923
Well, Harry's in love with her.

1019
01:38:27,132 --> 01:38:30,886
- She's still his girl.
- Well, isn't that up to her?

1020
01:38:31,094 --> 01:38:35,682
- She doesn't really know who I am.
- Because you won't let her.

1021
01:38:35,891 --> 01:38:39,019
You're so mysterious all the time.

1022
01:38:39,269 --> 01:38:42,022
Tell me, would it be so dangerous...

1023
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:46,193
...to let Mary Jane know
how much you care?

1024
01:38:46,652 --> 01:38:49,071
Everybody else knows.

1025
01:38:51,990 --> 01:38:53,283
I'll be right back.

1026
01:38:53,992 --> 01:38:55,285
But...

1027
01:39:02,626 --> 01:39:04,628
Come on, pick up.

1028
01:39:04,795 --> 01:39:08,090
- Hey M.J.
- Hi. Sing your song at the beep.

1029
01:39:09,132 --> 01:39:11,176
M.J., it's Peter. You there?

1030
01:39:11,468 --> 01:39:14,304
Hello? You there?

1031
01:39:14,805 --> 01:39:19,309
I'm just calling to check up on you.
Will you call me when you get in?

1032
01:39:19,476 --> 01:39:20,894
All right, well...

1033
01:39:21,311 --> 01:39:22,354
Don't...

1034
01:39:23,146 --> 01:39:25,357
Don't go up any dark alleys.

1035
01:39:25,565 --> 01:39:27,067
Hello?

1036
01:39:29,486 --> 01:39:33,198
Can Spider-Man come out to play?

1037
01:39:33,407 --> 01:39:35,158
Where is she?

1038
01:40:21,413 --> 01:40:23,081
- What is that?
- That's cool!

1039
01:40:23,290 --> 01:40:27,919
The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the water spout

1040
01:40:28,086 --> 01:40:32,257
Down came the goblin
And took the spider out

1041
01:40:49,066 --> 01:40:50,817
Goblin, what have you done?

1042
01:41:33,277 --> 01:41:37,155
Spider-Man!
This is why only fools are heroes.

1043
01:41:37,531 --> 01:41:39,199
Because you never know...

1044
01:41:39,366 --> 01:41:44,121
...when some lunatic will come along
with a sadistic choice:

1045
01:41:45,247 --> 01:41:47,874
Let die the woman you love...

1046
01:41:52,170 --> 01:41:57,259
...or suffer the little children.

1047
01:41:59,636 --> 01:42:02,139
- Spider-Man!
- Save us!

1048
01:42:02,639 --> 01:42:04,933
Save us!

1049
01:42:05,225 --> 01:42:07,811
Make your choice, Spider-Man...

1050
01:42:08,020 --> 01:42:11,398
...and see how a hero is rewarded.

1051
01:42:11,565 --> 01:42:13,650
Don't do it, Goblin!

1052
01:42:13,817 --> 01:42:16,737
We are who we choose to be.

1053
01:42:16,987 --> 01:42:19,740
- Now, choose!
- No!

1054
01:42:48,435 --> 01:42:50,020
Everybody stay still!

1055
01:42:59,529 --> 01:43:00,822
Ahoy up there!

1056
01:43:00,989 --> 01:43:03,951
We're gonna bring the barge
right under you.

1057
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:15,587
- He's coming back!
- Listen. I need you to climb down.

1058
01:43:15,754 --> 01:43:17,255
- I can't.
- Yes, you can!

1059
01:43:22,344 --> 01:43:25,389
M.J., you can do it. You have to.

1060
01:43:25,555 --> 01:43:27,140
Trust me.

1061
01:43:28,642 --> 01:43:32,479
Hold on tight and go quickly.

1062
01:43:36,817 --> 01:43:38,860
- Hurry!
- I can't. I can't do it.

1063
01:43:39,069 --> 01:43:40,737
Hang on, Mary Jane!

1064
01:44:09,182 --> 01:44:11,810
- He's not gonna make it.
- He's gonna make it!

1065
01:44:21,695 --> 01:44:24,906
It's time to die.

1066
01:44:31,913 --> 01:44:35,751
- I got something for you!
- We ought to kick your ass!

1067
01:44:35,917 --> 01:44:39,338
Leave Spider-Man alone!
You'd pick on a guy saving kids?

1068
01:44:40,005 --> 01:44:43,508
You mess with Spidey,
you mess with New York!

1069
01:44:43,675 --> 01:44:47,220
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us!

1070
01:44:59,733 --> 01:45:01,526
Spider-Man, watch out!

1071
01:45:33,392 --> 01:45:37,646
Misery, misery, misery.
That's what you've chosen.

1072
01:45:38,563 --> 01:45:41,191
I offered you friendship...

1073
01:45:41,358 --> 01:45:43,235
...and you spat in my face.

1074
01:46:34,328 --> 01:46:37,998
You've spun your last web, Spider-Man.

1075
01:46:38,165 --> 01:46:41,501
Had you not been so selfish,
your girlfriend's death...

1076
01:46:41,668 --> 01:46:43,337
...would have been quick.

1077
01:46:43,503 --> 01:46:46,923
But now that you've really
pissed me off...

1078
01:46:47,174 --> 01:46:52,054
...I'm gonna finish her
nice and slow.

1079
01:46:56,642 --> 01:46:58,685
M.J. and I...

1080
01:46:59,519 --> 01:47:02,814
...we're gonna have a hell of a time.

1081
01:47:56,618 --> 01:47:58,161
Peter, stop!

1082
01:47:58,328 --> 01:48:00,789
Stop! It's me.

1083
01:48:09,756 --> 01:48:11,258
Mr. Osborn.

1084
01:48:11,425 --> 01:48:12,968
Thank God for you.

1085
01:48:13,176 --> 01:48:15,512
You killed those people
on that balcony.

1086
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,724
The Goblin killed!
I had nothing to do with it!

1087
01:48:18,890 --> 01:48:20,642
Don't let him take me again.

1088
01:48:20,809 --> 01:48:22,853
I beg you. Protect me.

1089
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:26,607
You tried to kill Aunt May.
You tried to kill Mary Jane.

1090
01:48:26,773 --> 01:48:28,275
But not you.

1091
01:48:28,942 --> 01:48:32,904
I tried to stop it.
But I couldn't stop it.

1092
01:48:33,113 --> 01:48:35,198
I would never hurt you.

1093
01:48:35,407 --> 01:48:37,326
I knew from the beginning...

1094
01:48:37,534 --> 01:48:40,454
...if anything ever happened to me...

1095
01:48:40,621 --> 01:48:42,748
...it was you I could count on.

1096
01:48:42,914 --> 01:48:46,293
You, Peter Parker, would save me,
and so you have.

1097
01:48:46,877 --> 01:48:48,712
Thank God for you.

1098
01:48:49,713 --> 01:48:51,131
Give me your hand.

1099
01:48:52,299 --> 01:48:55,719
Believe in me
as I believed in you.

1100
01:48:57,137 --> 01:48:59,931
I've been like a father to you.

1101
01:49:01,475 --> 01:49:03,143
Be a son to me now.

1102
01:49:04,937 --> 01:49:06,813
I have a father.

1103
01:49:07,564 --> 01:49:10,067
His name was Ben Parker.

1104
01:49:11,944 --> 01:49:13,403
Godspeed, Spider-Man.

1105
01:49:32,339 --> 01:49:33,840
Peter.

1106
01:49:36,176 --> 01:49:38,011
Don't tell Harry.

1107
01:50:09,710 --> 01:50:11,420
What have you done?

1108
01:50:11,586 --> 01:50:13,171
What have you done?!

1109
01:50:41,325 --> 01:50:43,368
I'm so sorry, Harry.

1110
01:50:44,286 --> 01:50:47,414
I know what it's like
to lose a father.

1111
01:50:49,583 --> 01:50:52,878
I didn't lose him.
He was stolen from me.

1112
01:50:54,463 --> 01:50:56,757
One day Spider-Man will pay.

1113
01:50:58,634 --> 01:51:01,762
I swear on my father's grave,
Spider-Man will pay.

1114
01:51:06,767 --> 01:51:08,602
Thank God for you, Peter.

1115
01:51:09,311 --> 01:51:11,772
You're the only family I have.

1116
01:51:36,296 --> 01:51:38,590
No matter what I do...

1117
01:51:38,757 --> 01:51:41,885
...no matter how hard I try...

1118
01:51:42,469 --> 01:51:46,306
...the ones I love will always
be the ones who pay.

1119
01:51:57,025 --> 01:51:59,361
You must miss him so much.

1120
01:52:00,320 --> 01:52:03,365
It's been so hard without him.

1121
01:52:06,285 --> 01:52:09,162
There's something
I've been wanting to tell you.

1122
01:52:10,956 --> 01:52:12,749
When I was up there...

1123
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:16,295
...and I thought I was gonna die...

1124
01:52:17,921 --> 01:52:21,758
...there was only one person
who I was thinking of.

1125
01:52:23,051 --> 01:52:26,263
And it wasn't who I thought it'd be.

1126
01:52:27,723 --> 01:52:30,142
It was you, Pete.

1127
01:52:31,018 --> 01:52:32,894
I kept thinking:

1128
01:52:33,312 --> 01:52:36,106
"I hope I make it through this...

1129
01:52:37,566 --> 01:52:41,945
...so I can see Peter Parker's face
one more time."

1130
01:52:43,322 --> 01:52:44,823
Really?

1131
01:52:45,198 --> 01:52:50,996
There's only one man
who's always been there for me...

1132
01:52:52,247 --> 01:52:54,207
...who makes me feel...

1133
01:52:54,666 --> 01:52:58,378
...like I'm more than I ever
thought I could be.

1134
01:53:00,505 --> 01:53:02,174
That I'm just...

1135
01:53:02,841 --> 01:53:04,343
...me.

1136
01:53:05,427 --> 01:53:07,346
And that's okay.

1137
01:53:09,556 --> 01:53:11,016
The truth is...

1138
01:53:13,143 --> 01:53:14,937
...I love you.

1139
01:53:17,064 --> 01:53:18,982
I love you so much, Peter.

1140
01:53:39,711 --> 01:53:44,466
All I wanted was to tell her
how much I loved her.

1141
01:53:44,633 --> 01:53:46,551
I can't...

1142
01:53:48,679 --> 01:53:50,222
You can't what?

1143
01:53:51,348 --> 01:53:52,808
Tell you...

1144
01:53:54,518 --> 01:53:58,855
...everything.
I mean, there's so much to tell.

1145
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:03,860
Yeah. There's so much to tell.

1146
01:54:04,778 --> 01:54:06,738
I want you to know...

1147
01:54:07,155 --> 01:54:09,825
...that I will always be there
for you.

1148
01:54:10,033 --> 01:54:13,996
I will always be there
to take care of you.

1149
01:54:14,997 --> 01:54:16,999
I promise you that.

1150
01:54:20,294 --> 01:54:22,587
I will always be your friend.

1151
01:54:25,500 --> 01:54:27,380
Only a friend...

1152
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:29,800
...Peter Parker?

1153
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:34,810
That's all I have to give.

1154
01:55:01,170 --> 01:55:03,840
Whatever life holds in store for me...

1155
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:06,880
...I will never forget these words:

1156
01:55:07,100 --> 01:55:12,135
"With great power
comes great responsibility."

1157
01:55:12,300 --> 01:55:14,550
This is my gift.

1158
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:16,850
My curse.

1159
01:55:17,350 --> 01:55:19,270
Who am I?

1160
01:55:19,645 --> 01:55:21,000
I'm Spider-Man.

The Amazing Spider-Man (2012)

3
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,485
Five, four, three...

4
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:06,275
two, one.

5
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:07,909
Ready or not, here I come.

6
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,607
Hey, Dad?

7
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,815
Dad!

8
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,170
<i>You'll stay with Aunt May...</i>

9
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,135
and Uncle Ben for a little while.

10
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:36,471
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

11
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,980
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

12
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,393
and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

13
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:47,687
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

14
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,408
Dad.

15
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,949
Be good.

16
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:14,550
Sorry.

17
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,556
Morning, Flash.

18
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,603
Good morning, Parker.

19
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,940
Hey. It's Peter, right?

20
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,190
I really like your photos.

21
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,983
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

22
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,109
Listen...

23
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,619
are you busy Friday night?

24
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,128
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

25
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,288
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

26
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:49,547
for his birthday.

27
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,801
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

28
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,299
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

29
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,214
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

30
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,507
Parker.

31
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,722
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

32
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,387
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

33
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,896
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

34
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,181
Like that?

35
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,066
- That's it.
- Okay.

36
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,594
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

37
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,129
<i>Eat it! Eat it!</i>

38
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,844
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

39
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,429
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

40
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,060
Come on!

41
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,391
Hey, Parker, come on.

42
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,931
Get a picture of this.

43
00:05:47,097 --> 00:05:50,271
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

44
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:52,401
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

45
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:53,608
Take the picture.

46
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,238
Put him down, Flash.

47
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:56,990
Take the picture.

48
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,742
Put him down, Eugene!

49
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,122
Hey, man.

50
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:06,620
Come on!

51
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,454
Get up, Parker!

52
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:10,874
Get up!

53
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,664
Come on! Come on!

54
00:06:12,831 --> 00:06:13,502
Get up!

55
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:17,802
Still not taking the picture.

56
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,638
Stay down, Parker!

57
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,632
Who wants one more?

58
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,391
- One more!
- Flash!

59
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,261
Flash...

60
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,304
we still on for after school today?

61
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,596
My house, 3:30?

62
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,980
I hope you did homework.

63
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,642
Last time, I was...

64
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,442
disappointed in you.

65
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,696
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

66
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:37,071
How about it?

67
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,447
Whatever.

68
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,428
I thought that was great
what you did.

69
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,430
<i>It was stupid...</i>

70
00:07:11,222 --> 00:07:12,189
but it was great.

71
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,066
You should go to...

72
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:15,977
the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

73
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,030
What's your name?

74
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,698
You don't know my name?

75
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,901
No, I know your name.

76
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:24,741
I want to know
if you know your name.

77
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:28,035
Peter.

78
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:31,285
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

79
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,548
I'd still go to the nurse though.

80
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,962
You're Gwen, right?

81
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,345
Gwen Stacy.

82
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,340
All right.

83
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,264
Hey.

84
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,348
<i>I'm making...</i>

85
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,229
spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

86
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,058
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

87
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:57,945
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

88
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,147
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

89
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,860
What happened to your face?

90
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,401
I'm all right. Just... I fell, skating.

91
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,156
It's all right.

92
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,868
Ben Parker, don't you even...

93
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,000
think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

94
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,205
My bowling trophies.

95
00:08:13,368 --> 00:08:14,915
Oh, well, then, by all means...

96
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,580
leave that box in my kitchen.

97
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,214
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

98
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:19,374
Why you kids...

99
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,168
ride those things, I'll never know.

100
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,927
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

101
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:24,713
Remember when we were stupid?

102
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,880
No.

103
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,175
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

104
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,263
Where's the flood?

105
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:30,928
Follow me. I'll show you.

106
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,311
- You serious?
- Yes.

107
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,097
All right.

108
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:36,933
<i>It's the condenser tray.</i>

109
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,695
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

110
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,777
This has got to be the fill line.

111
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:45,317
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

112
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,826
Can you fix it?

113
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:50,246
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

114
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:52,828
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

115
00:08:54,826 --> 00:08:56,544
How's the other guy look?

116
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:01,250
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

117
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:05,219
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

118
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:06,676
No, no.

119
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:07,930
All right.

120
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,183
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

121
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:13,638
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

122
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,898
Before you come up, see if...

123
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:19,480
...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.

124
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,621
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

125
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,380
They fix pipes and pump things.

126
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,381
If you ask them to...

127
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,343
I forgot all about that thing.

128
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,382
<i>It was your dad's.</i>

129
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:52,391
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

130
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,808
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

131
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,646
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

132
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,609
And guess who sold it to him.

133
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:07,445
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

134
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,699
That's how they met.

135
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,652
He asked you to...

136
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:12,787
keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

137
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,698
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

138
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:16,992
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

139
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,669
Yeah, I know.

140
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,675
Who's that?

141
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:28,382
Do you know who that is?

142
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,888
Some guy who worked with...

143
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,172
your dad, I guess.

144
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,975
Just take this off the table, all right?

145
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,187
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

146
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,226
- Now.
- All right.

147
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:44,394
Go on.

148
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,643
<i>I need you to be a good boy.</i>

149
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,932
Where are you going?

150
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:24,271
There's something...

151
00:11:24,434 --> 00:11:26,436
your mom and I have to do.

152
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,831
What is this?

153
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,966
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

154
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,379
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

155
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,185
Come in.

156
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:45,689
You okay?

157
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,192
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, my God.

158
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:49,648
You look just like him.

159
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,614
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

160
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,949
Listen...

161
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,580
I don't have much education.

162
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,206
You know that, Peter.

163
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:06,036
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

164
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,796
What I'm trying to say <i>is...</i>

165
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,708
I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

166
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,043
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

167
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,133
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not...

168
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,673
all right.

169
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,347
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

170
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,596
Curt Connors.

171
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:28,020
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

172
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,526
They worked together for years
and they were close.

173
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,063
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

174
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:35,190
He never even called.

175
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,573
Not once.

176
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,695
Go figure.

177
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,291
She's pretty.

178
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,752
Uncle Ben.

179
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,166
What?

180
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,252
You're a pretty great dad.

181
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,604
Excuse me.

182
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:53,563
What?

183
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,319
Can I help you?

184
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:57,151
I don't know. I'm here to see...

185
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,781
...Dr. Connors.
- Right.

186
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,817
You'll find yourself to the left.

187
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,404
You are here for the internship?

188
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,660
Yeah. Yeah.

189
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,915
Okay.

190
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,951
You'll find your badge to the left.

191
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:16,837
Having trouble finding yourself?

192
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:18,505
No. Yeah, I got it.

193
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,838
Okay...

194
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,881
Mr. Guevara.

195
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,137
<i>Welcome to Oscorp.</i>

196
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,147
<i>Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...</i>

197
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,981
<i>the Oscorp Tower houses
108 ﬂoors of innovation.</i>

198
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:41,153
<i>Our scientific minds are pushing the
boundaries of defence, biomedical...</i>

199
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,114
<i>and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.</i>

200
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,577
Welcome to Oscorp.

201
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,033
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

202
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,072
at Midtown Science...

203
00:15:48,239 --> 00:15:49,661
and head intern to Dr. Connors.

204
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:51,997
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

205
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,832
Where I go, you go.

206
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,713
That's the rule. Remember that...

207
00:15:55,872 --> 00:15:57,340
...all will be fine.
- Come on!

208
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,875
- If you forget that...
- Listen!

209
00:15:59,041 --> 00:15:59,963
Look, listen.

210
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,719
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

211
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:02,970
Just tell them...

212
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,176
Rodrigo Guevara is here!

213
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,510
My name's Rodrigo!

214
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,517
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

215
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,056
Shall we?

216
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,687
Come around this way.

217
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,072
Good afternoon, Gwen.

218
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,201
Dr. Connors.

219
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,112
Welcome.

220
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,078
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

221
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,493
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

222
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,911
I'm not a cripple...

223
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,422
I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

224
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,334
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

225
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,969
Like the Parkinson's patient...

226
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,846
who watches on in horror
<i>as</i> her body...

227
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:49,430
slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

228
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:53,438
whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

229
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:57,442
I want to create a world
without weakness.

230
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,570
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

231
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:01,938
Yes.

232
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,071
Stem cells?

233
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,824
Promising. But the solution...

234
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:07,781
I'm thinking of is more radical.

235
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:11,618
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

236
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,089
Person gets Parkinson's...

237
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,627
when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

238
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:25,795
start to disappear.

239
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,635
But a zebra fish has the ability...

240
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:30,016
to regenerate cells on command.

241
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,093
If you could give this ability...

242
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,139
to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

243
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,523
She's curing herself.

244
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,564
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

245
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,318
And you are...?

246
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,360
He's one of Midtown Science's...

247
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,029
...best and brightest.
- Really?

248
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:52,196
Second in his class.

249
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,165
- Second?
- Yeah.

250
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,166
Sure about that?

251
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:57,793
I'm pretty sure.

252
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:05,169
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in
the more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

253
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,219
Nice meeting you all.

254
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,841
If you'd like to gather round.

255
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:14,010
<i>Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.</i>

256
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,597
<i>Our planet's tree of
life is immense.</i>

257
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,314
<i>At Oscorp's...</i>

258
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:21,191
<i>- ... Cross-Species Division...
- H I.</i>

259
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,354
<i>we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods...</i>

260
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:26,988
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

261
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,284
Oh, yeah.

262
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:32,696
What are you doing here?

263
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,034
I work here. I don't.

264
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,789
I was gonna say I work here...

265
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,168
but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

266
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,203
You following me?

267
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,498
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

268
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:44,881
Why would you be here?

269
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,884
I just snuck in because...

270
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:48,465
I love science.

271
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:50,426
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

272
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,215
So you snuck in...?

273
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,554
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

274
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:57,641
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

275
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,056
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

276
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:04,193
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

277
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,482
Sorry. Yo.

278
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,992
Sorry.

279
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:39,007
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

280
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,972
They were disappointing.

281
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,895
Define "disappointing."

282
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,401
Another dead end.

283
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,232
It's the decay rate algorithm.

284
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,905
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

285
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,407
You said you were close.

286
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,738
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

287
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,118
He doesn't have time.

288
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,575
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

289
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,365
Save him.

290
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,543
Or we'll both lose our heads.

291
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,397
All right, give me the badge.

292
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,942
Give it to me.

293
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:36,981
Sorry.

294
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,253
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

295
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,009
I didn't mean to do that.

296
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:44,594
I didn't mean to...

297
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,509
I didn't... I didn't...

298
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,015
Get your hand off her!

299
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:50,851
I'm trying to get my... ~.

300
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,438
Are you kidding?

301
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,397
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,777
Are you kidding me?

303
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,072
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

304
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:04,531
Man, I'm sorry!

305
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,785
Man, are you all right?

306
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,244
- Take him down!
- Come on.

307
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,457
Get him, man! Get him!

308
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:18,499
No, man, no. Not my board.

309
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,963
Please, dude, don't...

310
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:22,969
Sorry!

311
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:27,929
Sorry. Sorry.

312
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:29,389
I'm so sorry.

313
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,892
<i>Cone y Island, next stop.</i>

314
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:38,026
<i>Next and final stop, Coney Island.</i>

315
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,701
Hey.

316
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:53,208
Hey. He)'...

317
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:54,584
Sorry. I'm late.

318
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,416
- I got...
- We've been so worried.

319
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:57,704
I know. I'm sorry.

320
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,214
Watch out!

321
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,472
That's a fly, Peter.

322
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,186
Yeah.

323
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,647
I'm so sorry...

324
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,982
I kept you guys UP...

325
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:24,490
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

326
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,446
and I'm hungry.

327
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:32,531
Meat loaf.

328
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:36,292
Drinking?

329
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,499
What's this?

330
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,038
I don't think so.

331
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,877
This is your meat loaf.

332
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,131
This beats all other meat loafs.

333
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,422
Something is very wrong.

334
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:50,094
Yeah.

335
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,305
Nobody likes your meat loaf.

336
00:25:58,474 --> 00:25:59,976
I got it.

337
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,823
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

338
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,820
I noticed that.

339
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,620
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meat loaf?

340
00:26:11,862 --> 00:26:14,081
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

341
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,913
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

342
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,831
Peter.

343
00:29:10,207 --> 00:29:11,333
What are you doing?

344
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,002
[Tl.

345
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,094
Homework.

346
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:16,801
Be careful.

347
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,557
Sure.

348
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,192
Dr. Connors.

349
00:29:31,395 --> 00:29:32,692
You don't remember me. I...

350
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:34,106
The intern from the other day.

351
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,363
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

352
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,823
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

353
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,330
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

354
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,865
I'm Richard Parker's son.

355
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,331
Pete r?

356
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:54,630
I'm afraid...

357
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,093
I can't help you much. I don't know
why they left or where they...

358
00:29:58,255 --> 00:29:59,006
were going.

359
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,268
Good reflexes.

360
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:04,804
Thank you.

361
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,902
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

362
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,528
Yeah.

363
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:14,859
It's something, you know.

364
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,820
So you really think...

365
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,701
...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.

366
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,329
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

367
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,240
Not just in the community at large
but at Oscorp, as well.

368
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,535
They called us mad scientists.

369
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:31,046
And then your father
bred the spiders...

370
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,581
and everything changed.

371
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,421
The results were
beyond encouraging.

372
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,551
They were spectacular.

373
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:41,682
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

374
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,808
Including my own.

375
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,894
Then it was over.

376
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:49,686
He was gone.

377
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,358
Took his research with him.

378
00:30:53,435 --> 00:30:56,029
And I knew without him, I...

379
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:05,197
<i>l...</i>

380
00:31:06,782 --> 00:31:08,955
I was angry.

381
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,205
So I stayed away from you...

382
00:31:13,372 --> 00:31:15,295
and your family.

383
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,380
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

384
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,386
Say...

385
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:29,137
Say it worked.

386
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,477
Say you got it to work.

387
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:35,944
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

388
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,985
What could the side effects be?

389
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:45,783
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

390
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,581
The problem was always...

391
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,161
The decay rate algorithm?

392
00:31:52,077 --> 00:31:53,624
- Right.
- Right.

393
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,164
Can I...?

394
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,004
Of course.

395
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:21,865
Extraordinary.

396
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,322
How did you come up with this?

397
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,623
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

398
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,708
...one day after school?
- Yeah.

399
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,671
Thank you.

400
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,316
Number one, Reggie.

401
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,402
Run it, buddy.

402
00:33:02,564 --> 00:33:04,111
Let's go, Reggie...

403
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,278
Rejected!

404
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,665
You did that on purpose, Flash!

405
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,918
I should've.
You better watch your back.

406
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:20,545
Hey.

407
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,384
All right?

408
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:30,929
Give it up.

409
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,523
Come on, man.

410
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,435
One sec.

411
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:46,241
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

412
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:51,662
That's right. Take it.

413
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,449
Go ahead. Take it.

414
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,269
Just take it.

415
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,812
All right, how about this?

416
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,643
All right?

417
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,732
How about that?

418
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:29,110
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

419
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:31,404
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

420
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,913
Yo, Flash, let's go.

421
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,573
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

422
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:36,491
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

423
00:34:36,658 --> 00:34:38,331
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

424
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,874
What you doing?

425
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:46,001
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

426
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,187
Peter's behaviour is just...

427
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,145
unacceptable.

428
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,185
<i>They won't make us pay...</i>

429
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,195
- ...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.

430
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:08,072
- Was that true?
- What?

431
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:10,029
What I heard in there just now.

432
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,161
Did you humiliate that boy?

433
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,201
Yeah, I did.

434
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,365
- But...
- But what?

435
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,000
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

436
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:20,877
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

437
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:24,456
Is he?

438
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,466
Yeah, yeah, but...

439
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,719
So all this is about getting even.

440
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:32,714
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

441
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:33,882
Am I right or wrong?

442
00:35:35,884 --> 00:35:37,477
Yeah, I thought so.

443
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,438
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

444
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,565
I had to change shifts at work...

445
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:46,399
so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

446
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:48,358
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

447
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,239
Okay, good.

448
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,693
She looks familiar.

449
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,705
The girl on your computer.

450
00:35:58,365 --> 00:35:59,537
Yeah.

451
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,669
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

452
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:05,088
Don't forget Aunt May.

453
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,585
Okay.

454
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:16,182
He's a character.

455
00:36:16,341 --> 00:36:17,342
That's my uncle.

456
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:19,557
He's a pathological liar.

457
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,096
He thought you were someone else.

458
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,765
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

459
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:27,061
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

460
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:28,945
- Right.
- So...

461
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:31,448
he must have seen...
I was touching up stuff.

462
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,775
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

463
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,615
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

464
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,207
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

465
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:43,585
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

466
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,834
So you want to... I don't know...?

467
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,130
Want to what?

468
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,011
I don't know.

469
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,888
<i>Just...</i>

470
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,605
I don't know... We could...

471
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,562
We could do something else,
or we could...

472
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:09,194
- If you don't feel like, we could...
- Yeah.

473
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,899
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

474
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,441
- Really?
- Sure.

475
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,158
Okay.

476
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,660
All right, good. Sounds good.

477
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:18,786
Cool.

478
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,867
Okay.

479
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,328
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

480
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,664
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

481
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:30,840
<i>But maybe...</i>

482
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:33,172
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

483
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,007
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

484
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:36,843
- Bye.
- All right.

485
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,475
We have protein structure, rDNA...

486
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,731
chromatography,
transgenics testing...

487
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:13,143
that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have...

488
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:16,104
- Human line testing over...
- I remember that.

489
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,944
I've seen that before.

490
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:19,403
The Ganali device.

491
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:22,285
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

492
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:24,946
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

493
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,956
It creates a cloud
which can be dispersed...

494
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,583
over a neighbourhood, even a city.

495
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:32,120
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

496
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,292
That's incredible.

497
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,709
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

498
00:39:37,876 --> 00:39:39,878
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

499
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,469
run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

500
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,934
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

501
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:50,313
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

502
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,974
that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

503
00:39:53,141 --> 00:39:54,984
You can imagine my envy.

504
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:57,066
We're trying to harness
this capability...

505
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,481
and transfer it
into our host subject:

506
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,900
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

507
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,115
Enter the algorithm now.

508
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,286
Need to take that?

509
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,084
<i>System ready...</i>

510
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,840
<i>for gene insertion.</i>

511
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,626
Okay.

512
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,545
Check.

513
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,638
See what I'm trying to do?

514
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,674
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

515

And thank you.

00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:11,974
Hey. Buddy, I got you.

534
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,602
Okay.

535
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,858
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

536
00:41:17,016 --> 00:41:18,893
Human trials aren't until next week.

537
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,696
There.

538
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,827
Hey.

539
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,368
Hey, I thought you...

540
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,457
Didn't you forget something?

541
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,371
What?

542
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:42,384
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

543
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:47,343
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

544
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:50,346
Be a man.

545
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,226
Get in there and apologise.

546
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,190
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

547
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,645
Honestly, you don't have...

548
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,401
to apologise to me. It's your...

549
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,358
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

550
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,106
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

551
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:07,196
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

552
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,487
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

553
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,123
in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

554
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:15,534
because you got distracted.

555
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,373
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

556
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,583
I am completely capable
of walking home...

557
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,794
You will not defend this boy!

558
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,253
- I'm not defending...
- You are!

559
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,919
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

560
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,632
You're a lot like your father.

561
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,298
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

562
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:33,594
but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

563
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,105
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

564
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,732
you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

565
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:41,484
That's what's at stake here.

566
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:42,643
Not choice.

567
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,812
Responsibility.

568
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,484
That is nice. That's great.

569
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,620
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

570
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:55,707
- What?
- Where is he?

571
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,830
Where's my dad?

572
00:42:57,992 --> 00:43:01,496
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

573
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,005
Oh, come on, how dare you?

574
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,882
How dare I? How dare you?

575
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,505
Where you going?

576
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,469
Peter, come back here, please.

577
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:25,145
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

578
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,158
Peter!

579
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,375
Pete r?

580
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:50,378
Peter!

581
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,433
It's $2.07.

582
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,934
It's $2.07.

583
00:44:01,097 --> 00:44:02,440
Yeah. No, I know.

584
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,442
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

585
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:07,899
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

586
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,277
- What?
- You can leave...

587
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:13,067
a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

588
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,157
to take a penny.
It's store policy.

589
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,742
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have <i>2</i> cents.

590
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,578
You can't afford milk, step aside.

591
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,993
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

592
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,503
We're talking about <i>2</i> cents.

593
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,708
Just step aside, kid.

594
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:32,636
Really?

595
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,393
Yo, not cool, bro.

596
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,276
Hey, man, stop!

597
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:52,907
Somebody stop that guy!

598
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:54,442
Hey, kid, little help?

599
00:44:54,609 --> 00:44:55,986
Not my policy.

600
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:57,619
Somebody stop that dude!

601
00:44:58,613 --> 00:44:59,284
Hey!

602
00:44:59,447 --> 00:45:00,744
Hey, stop!

603
00:45:01,908 --> 00:45:03,535
Somebody stop that dude!

604
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:13,086
Hey!

605
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:45,493
Oh, God, oh, God.

606
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,207
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

607
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,455
Call an ambulance!

608
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:52,045
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

609
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,340
Oh, God, oh, my God.

610
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,723
Oh, God.

611
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,471
No.

612
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,607
<i>Oh, Jesus.</i>

613
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,491
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

614
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:22,704
No, I don't know him.

615
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:26,409
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

616
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:28,543
are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

617
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,376
Okay.

618
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:37,340
Can I have that?

619
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,880
Sure.

620
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,183
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

621
00:46:43,342 --> 00:46:44,093
<i>tattooed...</i>

622
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:45,512
<i>on his left hand.</i>

623
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:17,503
<i>Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...</i>

624
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,803
<i>and I'm sorry about that.</i>

625
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,598
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

626
00:47:38,731 --> 00:47:40,404
Hey, Parker.

627
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,528
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

628
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,626
It feels better, right?

629
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,121
Look, your uncle died.

630
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,256
I'm sorry.

631
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,882
I get it.

632
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,838
I'm sorry.

633
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,803
Okay?

634
00:48:07,093 --> 00:48:08,345
Peter.

635
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,013
Stay away from him.

636
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:54,181
- You understand?
- Hey!

637
00:48:54,348 --> 00:48:55,770
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

638
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,315
You like beating on girls?

639
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,022
You like beating on old men?

640
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:01,859
Hey, pal...

641
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:02,818
keep walking.

642
00:49:02,982 --> 00:49:05,405
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

643
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:07,243
I asked you a question.

644
00:49:07,403 --> 00:49:08,325
Nicky, no!

645
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:09,204
That the gun?

646
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,455
You gonna kill me too?

647
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,576
Hey! Stop it!

648
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,415
Hey. Get off!

649
00:49:16,537 --> 00:49:17,834
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

650
00:49:17,997 --> 00:49:19,214
Back up!

651
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:22,001
This guy is crazy!

652
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:23,885
Get him!

653
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,635
Get back here, man! Get him!

654
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,233
Follow him!

655
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,610
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

656
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:53,741
Go, go, go!

657
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,292
There he is!

658
00:49:56,452 --> 00:49:57,294
Can't get away!

659
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:15,771
<i>He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.</i>

660
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:28,526
Ch, yeah?

661
00:50:28,692 --> 00:50:29,693
Come on!

662
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,664
I know what you look like!

663
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,625
You hear me?

664
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,416
I've seen your face!

665
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,834
Is that all you got?

666
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:26,000
Just take it, take it.

667
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,182
<i>Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders...</i>

668
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:38,767
<i>Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength is unparalleled.

<i>of the lightweight cable.</i>

<i>Last seen on foot

679
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,005
Hey.

680
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,807
You got a description?

681
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:44,187
Well, no, he wears a mask.

682
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,977
A mask?

683
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,312
Most of his victims...

684
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:50,853
are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

685
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,397
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

686
00:53:53,564 --> 00:53:56,192
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

687
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,484
Get me out of here.

688
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,245
Hey. Look!

689
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,341
Spandex. Spandex.

690
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,127
Everything...

691
00:54:15,294 --> 00:54:16,170
spandex.

692
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:18,676
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

693
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:20,682
of both mass and acceleration.

694
00:54:20,841 --> 00:54:22,639
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

695
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:25,270
the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

696
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:29,184
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

697
00:55:05,552 --> 00:55:07,020
Hey, Aunt May.

698
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,519
Yeah. Eggs?

699
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:10,853
Organic, got it.

700
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,676
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

701
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:47,811
don't dress like a car thief, man.

702
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,517
What are you? You a cop?

703
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:54,602
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

704
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:56,270
You know, you're...

705
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,442
You've got a mind...

706
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,073
of the true scholar, sir.

707
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:02,610
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

708
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:04,277
Good thinking.

709
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,991
Get out the window.

710
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:07,451
There you go. You got it.

711
00:56:15,873 --> 00:56:17,295
Crotch!

712
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:22,471
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

713
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,801
Yes, it's a real knife.

714
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,466
My weakness, it's small knives.

715
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,225
- Just let me go.
- Anything but...

716
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,307
knives! Oh, it's so simple.

717
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,937
- That was cool.
- What is this?

718
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:33,690
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

719
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:34,520
Let me go!

720
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:38,153
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

721
00:56:38,312 --> 00:56:39,438
Knock it off, man. No!

722
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,987
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

723
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:44,864
That isn't funny.

724
00:56:45,027 --> 00:56:46,495
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

725
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,840
This could've gone a lot worse.

726
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,967
Now hold still.

727
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,849
Boys in blue here.

728
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:10,511
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

729
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:12,520
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

730
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,680
You serious?

731
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,019
Who are you?

732
00:57:15,432 --> 00:57:17,150
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

733
00:57:17,309 --> 00:57:18,105
Freeze!

734
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,697
I just did 80 percent of your job.

735
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:23,982
And that?

736
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,071
That's how you repay me?

737
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:29,867
Hold it right there!

738
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:51,931
Well, that was fun.

739
00:57:53,387 --> 00:57:55,014
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

740
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,102
What are you doing?

741
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:05,782
Hey, watch out.

742
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:08,740
I'm swinging here.

743
00:58:23,875 --> 00:58:26,628
So 38 of New York's finest...

744
00:58:26,795 --> 00:58:29,969
versus one guy in a unitard.

745
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,096
Am I correct?

746
00:58:46,106 --> 00:58:47,653
You don't have to wait up for me.

747
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:49,113
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

748
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:50,277
Yes, I do.

749
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:51,787
- Okay.
- Where were you?

750
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:52,992
I was out.

751
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,123
Did you get the eggs?

752
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,160
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

753
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,543
I'm gonna get them now.

754
00:58:59,703 --> 00:59:01,296
No, you most certainly will not.

755
00:59:01,455 --> 00:59:03,457
Not at this hour.

756
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,169
Look at me, Peter.

757
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,514
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

758
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:22,314
Peter. Where do you go?

759
00:59:22,476 --> 00:59:23,944
Who does this to you?

760
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,900
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

761
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,065
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

762
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,279
please, please go to sleep.

763
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:33,491
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

764
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,501
Peter, listen to me.

765
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:49,427
Secrets have a cost.

766
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,133
They're not for free.

767
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,515
Not now, not ever.

768
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:03,191
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

769
01:00:03,517 --> 01:00:06,691
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

770
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,446
It's a miracle.

771
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,198
No, it's hard work and promise.

772
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,359
It's a step closer to the primate lab.

773
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,278
He doesn't have time
for every little step.

774
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,366
Little?

775
01:00:15,529 --> 01:00:17,076
I just mean he can't wait.

776
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:18,912
Well, he'll have to.

777
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:20,997
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

778
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,035
That's not what...

779
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,044
I'm saying...

780
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,375
So, what are you saying?

781
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:27,336
You have to start human trials.

782
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:28,792
Now.

783
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,132
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

784
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,262
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

785
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,471
Even Norman Osborn.

786
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,634
We are not finished.

787
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:39,394
Human trials?

788
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,147
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

789
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,899
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

790
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:47,937
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

791
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,446
You've gotta be kidding me.

792
01:00:50,564 --> 01:00:51,656
I don't think I am.

793
01:00:58,113 --> 01:01:00,411
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

794
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:01,746
About 15 years late.

795
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,751
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

796
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,412
Richard Parker wore it well.

797
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:08,423
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

798
01:01:08,582 --> 01:01:10,050
I had nothing to do with that.

799
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:11,755
Is that what you told his son?

800
01:01:17,424 --> 01:01:18,721
I don't know what you're saying.

801
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,433
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

802
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,265
I'll remind you what happened.

803
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,902
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

804
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:34,445
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

805
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:37,194
<i>L...</i>

806
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,453
I won't.

807
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,290
Fine.

808
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,597
The formula is ours now anyway.

809
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,552
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

810
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,265
I'm shutting you down.

811
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:06,352
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

812
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:10,018
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

813
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,237
Right, Freddy?

814
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,500
- Hey.
- Hi.

815
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:30,459
How's it going?

816
01:02:30,622 --> 01:02:31,839
Where you headed?

817
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,381
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

818
01:02:35,877 --> 01:02:37,504
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

819
01:02:37,671 --> 01:02:39,344
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

820
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:40,758
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

821
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,551
Maybe I got a rash or...

822
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,515
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

823
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,481
Do you like branzino?

824
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:50,859
Like, a fish.

825
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,860
No, no. I know. I know.

826
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,238
Well, if you want...

827
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:59,903
you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

828
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,367
My mom's making branzino.

829
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:04,330
So...

830
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,331
It's apartment...

831
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,834
2016. I didn't write that part down.

832
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:09,336
I don't know why I...

833
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,337
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

834
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:12,873
2016.

835
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:22,283
Hi.

836
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:24,862
How did you get out there?

837
01:04:25,737 --> 01:04:27,284
The fire escape.

838
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,950
Your doorman's intimidating.

839
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,494
<i>It's 20 storeys.</i>

840
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,291
Yeah. It's all right.

841
01:04:38,458 --> 01:04:40,460
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

842
01:04:40,627 --> 01:04:42,345
Books.

843
01:04:42,504 --> 01:04:43,972
Shoes.

844
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,091
Oh, hey...

845
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,510
I got your mom...

846
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,053
these.

847
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:51,304
Oh, lovely.

848
01:04:51,471 --> 01:04:53,144
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

849
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:54,683
They were nice.

850
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:56,647
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

851
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,563
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

852
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,276
I'm gonna keep these.

853
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,491
You have your suit in there?

854
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,201
My Suit?

855
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,741
It's for dinner. Are you gonna...?

856
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:12,033
Are you gonna wear that?

857
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:13,201
- That's...
- Hey, hon.

858
01:05:18,832 --> 01:05:19,754
You must be Peter.

859
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,759
Dad, this is Peter.

860
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:25,638
Nice to meet you, sir.

861
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:27,966
Nice to meet you.

862
01:05:28,133 --> 01:05:29,726
Dinner's ready.

863
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:31,853
Hope you like branzino.

864
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,558
Who doesn't?

865
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,415
<i>Emma, it's Curt.</i>

866
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,377
- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.

867
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:40,379
<i>The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

868
01:06:40,538 --> 01:06:41,755
No. He can't, Emma.

869
01:06:41,915 --> 01:06:44,213
You have to stop him. He...

870
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,798
<i>I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.</i>

871
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:49,931
<i>I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.</i>

872
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:03,278
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

873
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,484
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

874
01:07:05,647 --> 01:07:06,899
Bridge! Take the bridge.

875
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:08,408
All right, we'll do that.

876
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:09,658
Hey, you all right...

877
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:10,568
back there?

878
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:12,157
You tweaking...

879
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,537
man?

880
01:07:14,656 --> 01:07:16,283
Just drive.

881
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,083
Okay.

882
01:07:24,332 --> 01:07:25,834
You're having trouble there?

883
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,673
The head goes on the other...

884
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:29,382
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

885
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,763
Oh, I...

886
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:32,014
I got no idea.

887
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,720
First time.

888
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,476
- Branzino.
- George.

889
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:38,388
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

890
01:07:38,555 --> 01:07:40,148
No, we didn't catch him yet.

891
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:42,183
But we will. He's an amateur...

892
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,069
who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

893
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:47,105
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

894
01:07:47,272 --> 01:07:48,649
but he's still dangerous.

895
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:50,992
He's assaulting people?

896
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:53,820
I'm not sure.

897
01:07:53,987 --> 01:07:55,455
I mean, I saw that video...

898
01:07:55,613 --> 01:07:57,581
with him and the car thief, and...

899
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,869
I think most people
would say that he was...

900
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:02,996
providing a public service.

901
01:08:03,705 --> 01:08:05,673
Most people would be wrong.

902
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:10,428
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

903
01:08:10,587 --> 01:08:11,839
So why wasn't he then?

904
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:16,889
Let me illuminate you.

905
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:19,679
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

906
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,065
the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

907
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:25,227
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

908
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,896
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

909
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:28,938
Good.

910
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,357
<i>I know.</i>

911
01:08:30,523 --> 01:08:33,197
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

912
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,111
a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

913
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,576
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

914
01:08:37,739 --> 01:08:39,116
I saw a video on the internet...

915
01:08:39,282 --> 01:08:40,829
You saw the video on the Internet.

916
01:08:40,992 --> 01:08:43,211
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

917
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,336
If you watch the video...

918
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:45,963
Maybe send you a link?

919
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:47,795
It looks like he's trying to help.

920
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,836
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

921
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:51,673
No, no.

922
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:53,554
I'm not saying he's a hero.

923
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:56,057
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

924
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,558
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

925
01:08:57,717 --> 01:08:59,094
Something the police can't?

926
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:00,807
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

927
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:02,517
Sit around eating doughnuts...

928
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,478
with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

929
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:06,735
- George. George.
- Daddy.

930
01:09:06,893 --> 01:09:07,610
- Up your what?
- Howard.

931
01:09:07,769 --> 01:09:09,612
He stands for what you stand for.

932
01:09:09,771 --> 01:09:11,318
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

933
01:09:11,481 --> 01:09:13,575
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

934
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,326
Okay? I wear a badge.

935
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:18,534
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

936
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:21,245
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

937
01:09:21,407 --> 01:09:23,580
like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

938
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:26,747
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

939
01:09:26,913 --> 01:09:28,756
Let's get some air, Peter.

940
01:09:29,374 --> 01:09:31,547
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

941
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,763
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

942
01:09:35,922 --> 01:09:38,220
if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

943
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:41,683
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

944
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,938
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

945
01:09:45,640 --> 01:09:48,189
- Dad.
- Yeah?

946
01:09:54,941 --> 01:09:56,864
Well, that was something.

947
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,414
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

948
01:10:01,572 --> 01:10:04,200
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you.

949
01:10:08,955 --> 01:10:11,674
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

950
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,795
Okay.

951
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,221
I've been bitten...

952
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:26,435
So have I.

953
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:33,316
Okay.

954
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,317
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

955
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:39,235
I gotta tell you this one thing about...

956
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:42,246
...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.

957
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,078
What?

958
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,493
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

959
01:10:46,659 --> 01:10:48,332
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

960
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:50,747
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

961
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:54,759
It's impo... I wish I could just...

962
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:56,169
I can't. It's hard to say.

963
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,336
Just say it.

964
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,631
- I don't know.
- Say it.

965
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,764
What? What?

966
01:11:07,221 --> 01:11:08,939
What?

967
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,854
Okay, then forget it.

968
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:24,455
You...?

969
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,208
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

970
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,715
Gwen?

971
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,308
Gwen...

972
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,266
Your father wants you to come inside.

973
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:48,895
Okay.

974
01:11:49,055 --> 01:11:50,056
- Okay?
- Yeah.

975
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:53,897
Gwen.

976
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,733
I'm coming.

977
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:28,845
Oh, I'm in trouble.

978
01:12:52,535 --> 01:12:53,411
Will you please...

979
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,455
find out what is going on, Alfred?

980
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:03,762
Excellent.

981
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,058
Hey!

982
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:12,188
Hey! What is that?

983
01:13:12,346 --> 01:13:14,223
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

984
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:15,812
Get back in the car!

985
01:13:20,897 --> 01:13:22,274
Help!

986
01:13:23,983 --> 01:13:24,859
Help!

987
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,201
Incoming!

988
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:28,889
Somebody help!

989
01:14:29,715 --> 01:14:31,388
Help me! My kid is trapped!

990
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,315
I want my dad!

991
01:14:42,645 --> 01:14:43,692
Dad!

992
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,231
'Hey' hey. Hey - Help! '.

993
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,069
Hey, buddy.

994
01:14:46,232 --> 01:14:47,404
- It's okay.
- Get away.

995
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:49,485
- Help!
- Hey, look.

996
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:52,905
Just a normal guy, all right?

997
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,491
Wanna hold this?

998
01:14:57,201 --> 01:14:57,997
Hold my mask.

999
01:14:58,619 --> 01:14:59,541
All right.

1000
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:02,548
What's your name?

1001
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:03,503
Jack?

1002
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:06,090
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

1003
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:09,213
Okay, stay very still.

1004
01:15:09,380 --> 01:15:10,222
All right.

1005
01:15:10,381 --> 01:15:11,633
Okay, <i>I</i> 9011 YOU.

1006
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:16,724
Okay, look.

1007
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,514
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1008
01:15:18,681 --> 01:15:20,729
to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1009
01:15:20,975 --> 01:15:23,649
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

1010
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,941
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1011
01:15:28,107 --> 01:15:29,825
All right, okay.

1012
01:15:43,456 --> 01:15:44,799
Jack, climb now.

1013
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:46,584
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1014
01:15:51,964 --> 01:15:53,966
Put it on, the mask.

1015
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:55,555
It's gonna make you strong.

1016
01:15:56,135 --> 01:15:57,478
Jack, trust me.

1017
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:58,603
Put it on.

1018
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:02,016
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1019
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:03,309
Okay, now, climb.

1020
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:04,477
Come on, Jack.

1021
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:08,901
Do me a favour.

1022
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,567
A little faster, okay, bud?

1023
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,160
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1024
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:14,411
That's it. Keep coming.

1025
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:15,992
Keep it coming.

1026
01:16:16,155 --> 01:16:17,202
Keep coming.

1027
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:19,458
No!

1028
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,808
Jack. Oh, God.

1029
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:37,468
Thank God.

1030
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:40,521
You okay?

1031
01:16:43,557 --> 01:16:45,025
My son. My son.

1032
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:46,977
Oh, my son.

1033
01:16:47,144 --> 01:16:48,896
My son.

1034
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,447
Who are you?

1035
01:16:56,862 --> 01:16:58,364
Spider-Man.

1036
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,420
Beautiful.

1037
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:56,635
Settle down, guys.

1038
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,258
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1039
01:17:59,425 --> 01:18:01,598
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately...

1040
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:05,230
9 p.m. last night, an incident
took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1041
01:18:05,764 --> 01:18:07,607
<i>Much of what occurred
is speculation...</i>

1042
01:18:07,766 --> 01:18:10,565
<i>at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...</i>

1043
01:18:10,728 --> 01:18:14,153
<i>to the crime, as well as
our own preliminary findings, have...</i>

1044
01:18:14,315 --> 01:18:15,441
<i>positively placed...</i>

1045
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:17,281
<i>one individual at the scene.</i>

1046
01:18:17,443 --> 01:18:18,911
<i>Which is why, this morning...</i>

1047
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,491
<i>I am issuing a warrant...</i>

1048
01:18:20,654 --> 01:18:23,999
<i>for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.</i>

1049
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:33,635
<i>And lastly, city council members met with
homeowners and airport officials...</i>

1050
01:18:33,792 --> 01:18:35,465
<i>in the first of four meetings...</i>

1051
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,137
It's so beautiful.

1052
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,146
Knows how to bite though.

1053
01:18:46,305 --> 01:18:48,057
Who else knows about this?

1054
01:18:48,224 --> 01:18:49,100
Just you.

1055
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:50,518
Really?

1056
01:18:52,978 --> 01:18:54,901
<i>Hey, you don't...</i>

1057
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:58,242
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1058
01:18:59,109 --> 01:19:00,611
Of course not.

1059
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,998
Does it scare you?

1060
01:19:04,156 --> 01:19:05,999
What you can do?

1061
01:19:08,494 --> 01:19:09,837
No.

1062
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:12,047
No.

1063
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,134
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1064
01:19:15,668 --> 01:19:18,137
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1065
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,051
You gotta lay low.

1066
01:19:20,839 --> 01:19:22,261
No, can't do that.

1067
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,971
You've got to.

1068
01:19:24,802 --> 01:19:26,304
I mean, why...?

1069
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:29,106
Because of last night.

1070
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,267
Those people on the bridge.

1071
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:35,438
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1072
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:37,777
So...

1073
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,613
I gotta go after it.

1074
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,157
That's not your job.

1075
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,163
Maybe it is.

1076
01:19:50,077 --> 01:19:51,624
I really liked kissing you.

1077
01:19:54,248 --> 01:19:55,750
You're an amazing kisser.

1078
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,716
Well, you know, it was...

1079
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:01,880
It was good for me too.

1080
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,177
Yeah?

1081
01:20:15,602 --> 01:20:16,728
Who did that?

1082
01:20:38,459 --> 01:20:39,460
Hello!

1083
01:20:49,094 --> 01:20:51,313
It's not nice to snoop.

1084
01:20:54,224 --> 01:20:56,101
I gave everyone the week off.

1085
01:20:58,354 --> 01:20:59,025
Yeah.

1086
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:01,615
Shouldn't you be at school?

1087
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,407
No, I got a free track.

1088
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,571
I wanted to ask you a question.

1089
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,327
How would a predator...

1090
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,787
track a reptile?

1091
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:13,793
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1092
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,204
of their food chain.

1093
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:16,873
Kings of their domain.

1094
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,541
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1095
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:21,301
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1096
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,094
Just asking a question.

1097
01:21:26,256 --> 01:21:29,100
I got school stuff.

1098
01:21:29,259 --> 01:21:31,261
Biology profiles to do.

1099
01:21:31,678 --> 01:21:33,931
So because of the cold blood...

1100
01:21:34,098 --> 01:21:36,021
would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1101
01:21:36,183 --> 01:21:37,560
You'd have to catch one first.

1102
01:21:38,477 --> 01:21:41,777
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1103
01:21:41,939 --> 01:21:43,441
Beautiful and quite large.

1104
01:21:44,608 --> 01:21:46,576
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1105
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:48,737
No, it's not yet classified.

1106
01:21:51,698 --> 01:21:53,700
But it can be aggressive...

1107
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,536
if threatened.

1108
01:22:03,293 --> 01:22:04,545
Doc, you all right?

1109
01:22:04,711 --> 01:22:07,339
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1110
01:22:07,506 --> 01:22:09,053
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1111
01:22:09,216 --> 01:22:11,969
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1112
01:22:12,136 --> 01:22:14,559
I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1113
01:22:15,180 --> 01:22:17,478
Good. Good, good.

1114
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:19,859
Good.

1115
01:22:20,436 --> 01:22:23,360
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

1116
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:26,484
Wonderful things are coming.

1117
01:22:27,734 --> 01:22:29,532
Wonderful things.

1118
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,381
Fred?

1119
01:22:50,174 --> 01:22:52,393
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1120
01:22:52,551 --> 01:22:55,054
running around
you would be the first to know.

1121
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:57,769
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right'?

1122
01:22:57,931 --> 01:22:59,979
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1123
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,361
Okay. Bye-bye...

1124
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:04,396
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1125
01:23:04,563 --> 01:23:06,406
...not in school?
- Got a free track.

1126
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,817
Okay, well, I do not.

1127
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,235
So make your point quickly.

1128
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,779
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1129
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:14,243
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

1130
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,999
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

1131
01:23:16,158 --> 01:23:17,535
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

1132
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,203
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors...

1133
01:23:19,369 --> 01:23:21,371
who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1134
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,755
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1135
01:23:22,915 --> 01:23:26,215
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1136
01:23:26,376 --> 01:23:28,424
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1137
01:23:28,587 --> 01:23:30,760
You would have me believe
that he...

1138
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:33,142
is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1139
01:23:33,300 --> 01:23:36,975
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1140
01:23:40,224 --> 01:23:41,771
Let me ask you a question.

1141
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:45,063
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1142
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:47,698
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1143
01:23:47,856 --> 01:23:50,905
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1144
01:23:51,068 --> 01:23:54,618
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1145
01:23:54,780 --> 01:23:57,249
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1146
01:23:57,407 --> 01:24:01,128
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1147
01:24:01,286 --> 01:24:03,755
Okay. All right, I get it.

1148
01:24:04,623 --> 01:24:05,670
Here's what we'll do.

1149
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:08,919
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1150
01:24:09,086 --> 01:24:11,305
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1151
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:13,511
of this fine, fair city of ours.

1152
01:24:13,674 --> 01:24:15,927
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1153
01:24:16,093 --> 01:24:19,063
...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1154
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:22,270
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1155
01:24:22,432 --> 01:24:24,059
He is a danger to everybody.

1156
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:26,479
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1157
01:24:30,816 --> 01:24:32,159
Jimmy.

1158
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:36,239
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1159
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,749
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1160
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,317
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1161
01:25:06,476 --> 01:25:08,023
Current temperature: 89.7.

1162
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:09,654
Steady for 48 hours.

1163
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,316
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1164
01:25:12,482 --> 01:25:14,155
consistent with subject's past.

1165
01:25:19,906 --> 01:25:21,579
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1166
01:25:21,742 --> 01:25:23,244
Marked enhancement...

1167
01:25:23,410 --> 01:25:24,753
in muscle response...

1168
01:25:24,911 --> 01:25:26,288
strength and elasticity.

1169
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:36,223
Eyesight similarly improved.

1170
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,884
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1171
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,145
This is no longer about curing ills.

1172
01:25:46,683 --> 01:25:48,060
This is about...

1173
01:25:48,226 --> 01:25:49,318
finding perfection.

1174
01:25:58,570 --> 01:26:00,664
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1175
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:04,577
dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1176
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:41,131
You stopped me once.

1177
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:44,351
You won't stop me again.

1178
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,348
I'm getting stronger every day!

1179
01:28:28,094 --> 01:28:29,641
Oh, that sucked.

1180
01:28:41,066 --> 01:28:42,739
Peter Parker.

1181
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:01,965
Come in.

1182
01:29:04,422 --> 01:29:05,765
You should maybe...

1183
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,767
consider coming in
through the lobby.

1184
01:29:09,386 --> 01:29:12,435
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1185
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:15,441
...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1186
01:29:15,684 --> 01:29:17,277
Peter.

1187
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:18,812
What happened?

1188
01:29:18,979 --> 01:29:20,322
You should see the other guy.

1189
01:29:22,148 --> 01:29:26,574
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1190
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,737
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1191
01:29:27,904 --> 01:29:28,826
Do you want cocoa?

1192
01:29:28,989 --> 01:29:30,115
Howard's making some.

1193
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,125
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1194
01:29:36,288 --> 01:29:37,961
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1195
01:29:38,123 --> 01:29:38,965
Okay.

1196
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:43,174
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1197
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,804
Well, that's impractical.

1198
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,385
And fattening.

1199
01:29:49,634 --> 01:29:50,726
Chocolate house.

1200
01:29:53,597 --> 01:29:55,395
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1201
01:29:55,557 --> 01:29:58,356
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work...

1202
01:29:58,518 --> 01:30:01,613
<i>I'm doing this...</i>

1203
01:30:01,771 --> 01:30:03,398
I have cramps.

1204
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:06,322
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1205
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,782
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1206
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,663
- Good.
- It's brutal.

1207
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:12,874
You don't want to know.

1208
01:30:13,033 --> 01:30:14,205
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

1209
01:30:14,367 --> 01:30:16,335
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1210
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:43,859
Easy, Bug Boy.

1211
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,028
What'd you call me?

1212
01:30:51,112 --> 01:30:52,955
I'm going to be all right.

1213
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:55,833
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1214
01:30:57,202 --> 01:30:59,705
I know what this is.

1215
01:30:59,871 --> 01:31:01,214
What is it?

1216
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:05,294
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1217
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,928
has left every morning...

1218
01:31:07,087 --> 01:31:09,761
and he's put a badge on his chest...

1219
01:31:09,923 --> 01:31:12,221
and strapped a gun to his hip.

1220
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,264
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1221
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,899
I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1222
01:31:29,442 --> 01:31:31,285
<i>L</i> 90! you.

1223
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:33,701
Okay?

1224
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:37,409
Okay?

1225
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:41,088
I gotta stop him, though.

1226
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:44,670
I have to, because I created him.

1227
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:49,429
What do you mean?

1228
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:52,933
I gave him an equation...

1229
01:31:55,468 --> 01:31:57,596
that made all of this possible.

1230
01:32:05,228 --> 01:32:08,107
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1231
01:32:08,273 --> 01:32:11,277
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1232
01:32:14,070 --> 01:32:16,539
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1233
01:32:19,868 --> 01:32:22,041
I have to fix it.

1234
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,796
Peter.

1235
01:32:27,834 --> 01:32:29,552
Hey.

1236
01:32:32,839 --> 01:32:34,967
Let's get out of here.

1237
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,931
Let's just get out of here.

1238
01:32:37,093 --> 01:32:38,811
Just for a minute. Can we?

1239
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,480
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1240
01:32:41,639 --> 01:32:42,811
- Yes.
- No.

1241
01:32:42,974 --> 01:32:44,146
Yes.

1242
01:32:44,309 --> 01:32:46,812
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1243
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:53,493
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

<i>One has to adapt to survive.</i>

1253
01:33:29,979 --> 01:33:32,732
"That, changing like the snake,
I might be free...

1254
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:36,529
to cast off ﬂesh
wherein I dwell confined."

1255
01:33:36,694 --> 01:33:39,868
<i>Would you give it all up
after all you know...</i>

1256
01:33:40,031 --> 01:33:40,998
<i>you can do?</i>

1257
01:33:41,157 --> 01:33:43,785
<i>All the power you feel.</i>

1258
01:33:47,288 --> 01:33:48,540
<i>I can save...</i>

1259
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:49,628
<i>them!</i>

1260
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:57,340
<i>You won't get in...</i>

1261
01:33:57,507 --> 01:33:58,679
<i>the way of my plan...</i>

1262
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:00,469
<i>Peter Parker!</i>

1263
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,122
Go. Go!

1264
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:06,492
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1265
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,053
All these souls...

1266
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:26,472
lost and alone.

1267
01:35:26,638 --> 01:35:27,514
I can save them.

1268
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,307
I can cure them.

1269
01:35:29,474 --> 01:35:31,067
There's no need to stop me...

1270
01:35:31,226 --> 01:35:32,148
Peter.

1271
01:35:41,694 --> 01:35:43,788
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1272
01:35:47,492 --> 01:35:49,119
Stop this. This isn't you.

1273
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,257
Let's talk this out.

1274
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:57,127
Doc!

1275
01:36:03,216 --> 01:36:04,263
Oh, boy.

1276
01:36:09,847 --> 01:36:10,894
You don't want to talk?

1277
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,271
There you go.

1278
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:18,113
Don't...

1279
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:20,491
make me...

1280
01:36:20,650 --> 01:36:21,651
have to...

1281
01:36:22,151 --> 01:36:23,118
you!

1282
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:32,337
That is disgusting.

1283
01:36:42,380 --> 01:36:43,757
Gwen.

1284
01:37:07,697 --> 01:37:09,916
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

1285
01:37:23,129 --> 01:37:24,176
Somebody's been...

1286
01:37:24,339 --> 01:37:26,012
a bad lizard.

1287
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,981
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1288
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,609
Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1289
01:38:27,777 --> 01:38:29,779
Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1290
01:38:41,416 --> 01:38:42,713
<i>- Hey.
- Where are you?</i>

1291
01:38:42,875 --> 01:38:43,797
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1292
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:47,339
I'm in the sewer, tracking him. I gotta
stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1293
01:38:47,505 --> 01:38:48,631
But we need an antidote.

1294
01:38:48,798 --> 01:38:51,392
<i>- Do you know how to run a serum?
- I do it all the time.</i>

1295
01:38:51,551 --> 01:38:53,974
Okay, great.
Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1296
01:38:54,137 --> 01:38:57,141
<i>I need you to access the
cross-species file. It's a blue serum.</i>

1297
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:59,434
File 12389.

1298
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,692
<i>Okay, got it.</i>

1299
01:39:00,852 --> 01:39:02,604
On my W93'...

1300
01:39:34,093 --> 01:39:37,723
<i>I spent my life as a scientist trying
to create a world without weakness...</i>

1301
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:40,062
<i>without outcasts.</i>

1302
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,773
<i>I sought to create
a stronger human being...</i>

1303
01:39:42,935 --> 01:39:44,858
<i>but there's no such thing.</i>

1304
01:39:45,021 --> 01:39:48,275
<i>Human beings are weak,
pathetic, feeble-minded...</i>

1305
01:39:48,441 --> 01:39:50,114
<i>creatures.</i>

1306
01:39:50,276 --> 01:39:51,744
<i>Why be human at all...</i>

1307
01:39:51,903 --> 01:39:53,155
<i>when we can be so...</i>

1308
01:39:53,321 --> 01:39:54,163
<i>much more?</i>

1309
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,620
<i>Faster. Stronger.</i>

1310
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:58,204
<i>Smarter.</i>

1311
01:39:58,367 --> 01:40:01,211
<i>This is my gift to you.</i>

1312
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:11,385
Oscorp.

1313
01:40:13,633 --> 01:40:14,759
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1314
01:40:14,926 --> 01:40:17,395
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1315
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,772
...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?

1316
01:40:19,931 --> 01:40:21,148
Inside the high school.

1317
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:23,230
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1318
01:42:09,832 --> 01:42:12,711
<i>The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.</i>

1319
01:42:12,877 --> 01:42:14,675
<i>All efforts to stop
him have failed...</i>

1320
01:42:14,837 --> 01:42:18,057
<i>and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.</i>

1321
01:42:22,053 --> 01:42:22,929
- Hi.
- Where are you?

1322
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:24,392
<i>Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.</i>

1323
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:26,307
You have to get out of there now.

1324
01:42:26,474 --> 01:42:28,852
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.

1325
01:42:29,018 --> 01:42:31,487
<i>Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.</i>

1326
01:42:31,646 --> 01:42:34,195
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1327
01:42:34,357 --> 01:42:35,529
Eight minutes left.

1328
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:38,240
<i>You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?</i>

1329
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,745
You leave right now.

1330
01:42:39,904 --> 01:42:40,951
<i>That is an order, okay?</i>

1331
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:42,205
I'll get everybody out.

1332
01:42:42,365 --> 01:42:43,867
<i>Did you hear wh...?</i>

1333
01:42:44,033 --> 01:42:47,082
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1334
01:43:03,594 --> 01:43:04,766
He's heading south.

1335
01:43:15,523 --> 01:43:17,525
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1336
01:43:17,692 --> 01:43:19,444
You are surrounded. There is...

1337
01:43:19,610 --> 01:43:20,953
I"lO escape.

1338
01:43:21,404 --> 01:43:22,826
Go. go!

1339
01:44:24,759 --> 01:44:26,136
Clear!

1340
01:44:26,302 --> 01:44:27,428
Clear up top!

1341
01:44:29,263 --> 01:44:30,515
Clear, sir!

1342
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:31,853
All clear here, sir!

1343
01:44:57,333 --> 01:44:58,880
Freeze!

1344
01:44:59,543 --> 01:45:00,715
Down on the ground.

1345
01:45:00,878 --> 01:45:02,346
Your hands behind your head.

1346
01:45:02,505 --> 01:45:04,132
NOW!

1347
01:45:07,510 --> 01:45:08,978
Parker.

1348
01:45:10,846 --> 01:45:11,847
It's headed to Oscorp!

1349
01:45:12,014 --> 01:45:14,392
And your daughter's there right now.

1350
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:28,451
You gotta let me go.

1351
01:45:43,045 --> 01:45:43,796
Hold your fire!

1352
01:45:50,886 --> 01:45:53,389
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1353
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:55,979
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1354
01:45:56,141 --> 01:45:58,064
the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1355
01:45:58,227 --> 01:46:01,481
but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1356
01:46:17,788 --> 01:46:19,790
<i>Time remaining: one minute.</i>

1357
01:47:32,738 --> 01:47:34,832
<i>Antidote complete.</i>

1358
01:47:47,670 --> 01:47:49,388
Oh, man.

1359
01:47:49,546 --> 01:47:52,220
<i>We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.</i>

1360
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:54,056
<i>The New York Police Department...</i>

1361
01:47:54,218 --> 01:47:56,220
<i>has called for
a city-wide evacuation...</i>

1362
01:47:56,387 --> 01:47:58,355
<i>everything south of 54th Street.</i>

1363
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:00,979
<i>If you are south of 54th Street...</i>

1364
01:48:01,141 --> 01:48:03,610
<i>you have to move out
of the area immediately.</i>

1365
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:15,664
<i>Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.</i>

1366
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:16,870
<i>He looks injured...</i>

1367
01:48:17,032 --> 01:48:19,706
<i>and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.</i>

1368
01:48:19,868 --> 01:48:20,960
<i>That's the guy who...</i>

1369
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,497
saved my boy on the bridge.

1370
01:48:22,663 --> 01:48:24,040
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1371
01:48:24,206 --> 01:48:26,629
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1372
01:48:26,792 --> 01:48:29,386
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1373
01:48:29,545 --> 01:48:31,468
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1374
01:48:31,630 --> 01:48:33,724
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1375
01:48:33,882 --> 01:48:36,101
Get him on the phone for me.

1376
01:48:53,694 --> 01:48:56,322
Hey, Charlie, get me Enriquez
on 54th Street!

1377
01:48:56,488 --> 01:48:58,582
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1378
01:48:58,741 --> 01:49:01,085
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1379
01:49:02,453 --> 01:49:04,421
<i>All tower cranes on 6th...</i>

1380
01:49:04,580 --> 01:49:08,301
<i>swing your jib arms over the avenue.
Boom angles at 90 degrees.</i>

1381
01:49:08,459 --> 01:49:10,803
<i>Spider-Man needs those big boys
high and lined up.</i>

1382
01:49:10,961 --> 01:49:13,009
<i>Let's give him a clear approach.
Over.</i>

1383
01:49:46,747 --> 01:49:48,420
Come on, Parker.

1384
01:51:44,156 --> 01:51:44,873
Hey.

1385
01:51:45,157 --> 01:51:46,249
Dad!

1386
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,581
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

1387
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:50,587
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1388
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:53,625
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1389
01:51:53,790 --> 01:51:56,043
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1390
01:51:56,210 --> 01:51:57,382
I get it.

1391
01:51:57,544 --> 01:51:58,636
Give me this.

1392
01:51:58,795 --> 01:52:00,638
Get in the car.

1393
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:06,312
Please make sure he's okay.

1394
01:52:18,815 --> 01:52:21,819

No mother, no father...

1398
01:53:55,871 --> 01:53:57,623
no uncle.

1399
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:00,667
All alone.

1400
01:54:01,918 --> 01:54:02,919
He's not alone.

1401
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:24,574
<i>Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.</i>

1402

Gift from Gwen.

1404
01:54:37,662 --> 01:54:39,130

No.

1419
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:58,034
No!

1420
01:57:09,105 --> 01:57:10,231
The captain.

It's okay.

1424
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:19,623
We stopped him.

1425
01:57:20,283 --> 01:57:21,159
Okay.

Okay, okay, okay.

1428
01:57:26,331 --> 01:57:27,799
Look at me. Stay with me.

1429
01:57:27,958 --> 01:57:30,052
- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1430
01:57:30,210 --> 01:57:33,714
You need to be gone
when they get here.

1431
01:57:33,880 --> 01:57:35,223
Okay?

1432
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:36,679
I'm not going anywhere.

1433
01:57:37,259 --> 01:57:39,682
I was wrong about you, Peter.

1434
01:57:40,387 --> 01:57:41,934
This city needs you.

1435
01:57:43,932 --> 01:57:45,525
Here.

1436
01:57:45,684 --> 01:57:46,856
You're gonna need this.

1437
01:57:51,273 --> 01:57:53,241
You're gonna make enemies.

1438
01:57:55,652 --> 01:57:57,495
People will get hurt.

1439
01:57:59,072 --> 01:58:00,995
Sometimes the people closest to you.

1440
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:06,913
So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1441
01:58:08,832 --> 01:58:12,632
Leave Gwen out of it.

1442
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:16,798
Promise me that.

1443
01:58:22,429 --> 01:58:24,102
You promise me.

1444
01:59:37,796 --> 01:59:39,048
<i>An eerie calm...</i>

1445
01:59:39,214 --> 01:59:41,262
<i>has set in over New York City.</i>

1446
01:59:41,424 --> 01:59:42,721
<i>Apparently, some sort of...</i>

1447
01:59:42,884 --> 01:59:45,888
<i>aerosolised antidote
was launched from...</i>

1448
01:59:46,054 --> 01:59:49,274
<i>Oscorp Tower, which seems to have
counteracted the biotoxins.</i>

1449
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:52,402
<i>Residents of Lower Manhattan
can rest peacefully...</i>

1450
01:59:52,560 --> 01:59:54,562
<i>knowing that
the alleged mastermind...</i>

1451
01:59:54,729 --> 01:59:58,359
<i>of this terror plot,
Dr. Curtis Connors, is behind bars.</i>

1452
01:59:58,525 --> 01:59:59,902
<i>We've got John Ni/es...</i>

1453
02:00:00,068 --> 02:00:02,491
<i>on the street for a report
in Lower Manhattan.</i>

1454
02:00:02,654 --> 02:00:04,702
<i>John, what do you see?</i>

1455
02:00:37,564 --> 02:00:39,612
Sweetheart, it's all right.

1456
02:00:41,776 --> 02:00:43,653
It's all right.

1457
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:46,160
It's all right.

1458
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:47,623
Rough night.

1459
02:00:49,701 --> 02:00:51,374
It's gonna be all right.

1460
02:01:45,131 --> 02:01:46,849
Where have you been?

1461
02:01:49,844 --> 02:01:51,437
Hi.

1462
02:01:56,267 --> 02:01:57,894
My father died.

1463
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,608
There was a funeral.

1464
02:02:05,068 --> 02:02:06,411
They shot off...

1465
02:02:08,404 --> 02:02:11,157
rifles and they made speeches.

1466
02:02:14,702 --> 02:02:16,670
Two of my teachers showed up.

1467
02:02:18,081 --> 02:02:19,458
And Flash showed up.

1468
02:02:24,379 --> 02:02:27,007
Everyone was there but you.

1469
02:02:41,604 --> 02:02:43,732
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1470
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:48,032
I'm sorry. I can't...

1471
02:02:48,194 --> 02:02:49,616
What are you saying?

1472
02:02:49,779 --> 02:02:51,622
I can't see you any more.

1473
02:02:53,575 --> 02:02:55,043
I can't.

1474
02:03:20,643 --> 02:03:22,645
He made you promise, didn't he?

1475
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:30,529
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1476
02:03:57,013 --> 02:03:57,855
What a pretty...

1477
02:03:58,014 --> 02:03:58,890
girl.

1478
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:00,229
Yeah.

1479
02:04:00,391 --> 02:04:02,189
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1480
02:04:03,227 --> 02:04:04,900
Did you ask her out?

1481
02:04:08,650 --> 02:04:09,993
Why?

1482
02:04:11,069 --> 02:04:12,537
Can't.

1483
02:04:13,821 --> 02:04:15,198
Why?

1484
02:04:17,784 --> 02:04:19,502
I'm just no good for her.

1485
02:04:22,664 --> 02:04:26,134
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1486
02:04:27,168 --> 02:04:28,340
Anyone has a problem...

1487
02:04:28,503 --> 02:04:30,221
with that can talk to me.

1488
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:50,988
<i>Peter, I know things have been...</i>

1489
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:52,367
<i>difficult lately...</i>

1490
02:04:52,527 --> 02:04:54,621
<i>and I'm sorry about that.</i>

1491
02:04:55,029 --> 02:04:57,999
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

1492
02:04:58,157 --> 02:05:00,751
<i>Ever since you were a little boy...</i>

1493
02:05:00,910 --> 02:05:05,336
<i>you've been living with
so many unresolved things.</i>

1494
02:05:06,541 --> 02:05:08,839
<i>Well, take it from an old man:</i>

1495
02:05:09,419 --> 02:05:12,514
<i>Those things send us
down a road.</i>

1496
02:05:12,672 --> 02:05:13,764
<i>They make us...</i>

1497
02:05:13,923 --> 02:05:15,015
<i>who we are.</i>

1498
02:05:15,258 --> 02:05:20,515
<i>And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.</i>

1499
02:05:21,097 --> 02:05:23,520
<i>You owe the world your gifts.</i>

1500
02:05:24,100 --> 02:05:26,979
<i>You just have to figure out
how to use them.</i>

1501
02:05:27,520 --> 02:05:30,865
<i>And know that wherever
they take you...</i>

1502
02:05:31,024 --> 02:05:33,322
<i>we'll always be here.</i>

1503
02:05:34,152 --> 02:05:36,746
<i>So come on home, Peter.</i>

1504
02:05:37,613 --> 02:05:39,456
<i>You're my hero.</i>

1505
02:05:39,615 --> 02:05:41,117
<i>And I love you.</i>

1506
02:05:49,542 --> 02:05:51,260
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1507
02:05:51,419 --> 02:05:52,887
Hey. How's it going?

1508
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:55,215
You coming along, man?

1509
02:05:56,799 --> 02:05:57,641
Cool shirt.

1510
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:00,636
Yeah.

1511
02:06:00,803 --> 02:06:02,305
Dude's crazy.

1512
02:06:02,472 --> 02:06:03,849
But chicks dig him.

1513
02:06:06,642 --> 02:06:09,361
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1514
02:06:18,821 --> 02:06:21,700
<i>I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...</i>

1515
02:06:21,866 --> 02:06:25,120
that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1516
02:06:26,079 --> 02:06:28,173
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1517
02:06:28,331 --> 02:06:29,753
There is only one:

1518
02:06:30,666 --> 02:06:32,168
"Who am I“?"

1519
02:06:32,877 --> 02:06:34,800
Mr. Parker.

1520
02:06:34,962 --> 02:06:35,963
Tardy again.

1521
02:06:37,924 --> 02:06:39,767
At least we can always count on you.

1522
02:06:39,926 --> 02:06:42,679
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1523
02:06:42,845 --> 02:06:44,939
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1524
02:06:47,183 --> 02:06:49,356
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1525
02:06:49,519 --> 02:06:51,362
Okay, class, open your books.

1526
02:06:51,521 --> 02:06:53,523
Let's begin on page one.

1527
02:09:48,781 --> 02:09:51,375
Hello, doctor.

1528
02:09:51,534 --> 02:09:52,877
Did you tell the boy?

1529
02:09:53,035 --> 02:09:54,082
Tell him what?

1530
02:09:54,245 --> 02:09:58,000
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1531
02:09:59,667 --> 02:10:00,543
No.

1532
02:10:00,710 --> 02:10:02,303
Well, that's very good.

1533
02:10:02,628 --> 02:10:03,720
So we'll let him be...

1534
02:10:03,879 --> 02:10:04,846
for now.

1535
02:10:05,881 --> 02:10:07,975
You should leave him alone!

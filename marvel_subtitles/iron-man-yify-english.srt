1
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,629
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,714
This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,257
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

4
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,760
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,053
We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:39,932
-Oh, I see. So it's personal?
-No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,185
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly. . . I couldn't have called that.

8
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:45,729
I mean, I'd apologise,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,607
-I thought of you as a soldier first.
-I'm an airman.

10
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,442
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,320
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,198
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,076
-Sir, I have a question to ask.
-Yes, please.

14
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,871
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

15
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,082
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,625
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,628
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,589
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:16,552
-Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
-Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,473
All right.

21
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,684
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,352
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,020
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,065
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,236
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

26
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,910
-What's going on?
-Contact left!

27
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,662
What have we got?

28
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,999
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,125
-Stay down !
-Yeah.

30
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,008
Son of a bitch !

31
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,470
-Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun !
-Stay here!

32
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,126
Whoa!

33
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,843
<i>Tony Stark.</i>

34
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,764
<i>Visionary. Genius.</i>

35
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,517
<i>American patriot.</i>

36
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,726

<i>the son of legendary</i>
<i>weapons deveIoper Howard Stark</i>

38
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,941
<i>quickly stole the spotlight</i>
<i>with his brilliant and unique mind.</i>

39
00:04:36,025 --> 00:04:39,444
<i>At age four,</i>
<i>he buiIt his first circuit board.</i>

40
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,697
<i>At age six, his first engine.</i>

41
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,201
<i>And at 1 7, he graduated</i>
<i>summa cum Iaude from MIT.</i>

42
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,579
<i>Then, the passing of a titan.</i>

43
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,084
<i>Howard Stark's lifelong friend</i>

44
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:57,587
<i>steps in to help fill the gap</i>
<i>left by the legendary founder,</i>

45
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:01,133

<i>creating smarter weapons,</i>

50
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:16,982
<i>Today, Tony Stark has changed</i>

51
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,860
<i>by ensuring freedom</i>

00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:48,430
<i>to present this year's Apogee Award</i>
<i>to Mr Tony Stark.</i>

58
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,980
<i>Tony?</i>

59
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,870
-Thank you, Colonel.
-Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,624
<i>This is beautiful. Thank you.</i>
<i>Thank you all very much.</i>

61
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,125
<i>This is wonderfuI.</i>

62
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,046
<i>WeII, I'm not Tony Stark.</i>

63
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:28,053
<i>But if l were Tony,</i>
<i>l would tell you how honoured l feel</i>

64
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:33,100
<i>and what a joy it is</i>
<i>to receive this very prestigious award.</i>

65
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,976
<i>Tony, you know...</i>

66
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,980
<i>The best thing about Tony</i>
<i>is also the worst thing.</i>

67
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,440
<i>He's always working.</i>

68
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,946
Work it! Come on !

69
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,078
-We should just stay till the morning.
-You are unbelievable.

70
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:56,415
-Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
-Nobody roped me into anything !

71
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,582
-I'm so sorry.
-But they told me that

72
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,419
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honoured.

73
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,421
Of course I'd be deeply honoured.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,256
-So when do we do it?
-It's right here.

75
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,508
-Here you go.
-There it is. That was easy.

76
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,926
-I'm so sorry.
-Yeah, it's okay.

77
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,345
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

78
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,013
I don't have any of those
floating around.

79
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,182
We're gonna let it ride!

80
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,352
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

81
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,603
Okay, you, too.

82
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,522
-I don't blow on a man's dice.
-Come on, honey bear.

83
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,191
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And. . .

84
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,526
Two craps. Line away.

85
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,361
-That's what happens.
-Worse things have happened.

86
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,863
I think we're gonna be fine.
Colour me up, will you?

87
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,448
-This is where I exit.
-All right.

88
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,574
Tomorrow, don't be late.

89
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,825
-Yeah, you can count on it.
-I'm serious!

90
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,201
I know, I know.

91
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,872
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

92
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,545
Mr Stark! Excuse me, Mr Stark!

93
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,089
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

94
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,257
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

95
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,884
-She's cute.
-She's all right?

96
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,010
-Hi.
-Hi.

97
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,012
-Yeah. Okay, go.
-It's okay?

98
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,889
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

99
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,850
-What do you say to that?
-Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

100
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,518
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

101
00:07:58,603 --> 00:07:59,769
"The Merchant of Death"?

102
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,396
That's not bad.

103
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,275
-Let me guess. Berkeley?
-Brown, actually.

104
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,903
Well, Ms Brown,

105
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,447
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

106
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:13,241
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

107
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,535
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

108
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,661
Rehearse that much?

109
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,413
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

110
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,874
-I can see that.
-I'd like to show you first-hand.

111
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,210
All I want is a serious answer.

112
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,504
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

113
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,006
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

114
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,383
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

115
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,261
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

116
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,931
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

117
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,182
would call that being a hero.

118
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,434
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

119
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,686
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

120
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,522
by advancing medical technology

121
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,941
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

122
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,277
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

123
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,781
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

124
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,783
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

125
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,632
<i>Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

126
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,386
<i>The weather in MaIibu</i>
<i>is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.</i>

127
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,889
<i>The surf conditions are fair</i>
<i>with waist-to-shoulder high lines.</i>

128
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,475
<i>High tide will be at 1 0:52 a.m.</i>

129
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:38,743
Tony?

130
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,538
Hey, Tony?

131
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,562
<i>You are not authorised</i>
<i>to access this area.</i>

132
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,398
-Jesus.
-That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

133
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,568
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

134
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,403
and there's a car waiting for you outside

135
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,739
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

136
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,576
-You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
-Indeed I am.

137
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:25,081
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

138
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,543
I do anything and everything
that Mr Stark requires,

139
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,421
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

140
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:32,589
Will that be all?

141
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,107
Give me an exploded view.

142
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,444
<i>The compression in cylinder three</i>
<i>appears to be low.</i>

143
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,112
Log that.

144
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,951
-I'm gonna try again, right now.
-Please don't turn down my music.

145
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,078
I'll keep you posted.

146
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,913
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

147
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,332
-How'd she take it?
-Like a champ.

148
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,958
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

149
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,752
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

150
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,962
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

151
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,589
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

152
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,424
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

153
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,592
before I get you out of the door.

154
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,969
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

155
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,221
if it departs before you arrive?

156
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:24,641
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

157
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:26,351
Do you want it? Yes or no.

158
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,520
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

159
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,815
No. The Springs was actually
the neighbourhood in East Hampton

160
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,149
where he lived and worked,

161
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,776
-not "spring" like the season.
-So?

162
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,197
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

163
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,659
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

164
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,995
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech. . .

165
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,915
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down. . .

166
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,251
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

167
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,961
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

168
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,421
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

169
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,506
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

170
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,008
-As a matter of fact, I do.
-I don't like it when you have plans.

171
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,177
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

172
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,762
-It's your birthday?
-Yes.

173
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,305
I knew that. Already?

174
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,934
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

175
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:11,438
-Get yourself something nice from me.
-I already did.

176
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,982
-And?
-It was very nice.

177
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:17,485
-Yeah.
-Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr Stark.

178
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,280
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

179
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,492
Okay.

180
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,431
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

181
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:51,019
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

182
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,645
I got you. I got you.

183
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,189
What's wrong with you?

184
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,774
-What?
-Three hours.

185
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,026
I got caught doing a piece
<i>for Vanity Fair.</i>

186
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,069
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

187
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,697
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

188
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,325
Wheels up! Rock and roll !

189
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,960
-What you reading, platypus?
-Nothing.

190
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,254
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

191
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,090
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

192
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,592
-I said I was sorry.
-Good morning, Mr Stark.

193
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,843
You don't need to apologise to me.
I'm your man.

194
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,011
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he. . .

195
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,429
-I'm just indifferent right now.
-Hot towel?

196
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:27,722
You don't respect yourself,

197
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,140
-so I know you don't respect me.
-I respect you.

198
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm just your babysitter.

199
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:33,186
So, when you need
your diaper changed. . . Thank you.

200
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,438
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

201
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,190
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

202
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,650
-Thanks for reminding me.
-No, I'm not talking. . .

203
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,485
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

204
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,987
-You can't have sashimi without sake.
-You are constitutionally

205
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,531
incapable of being responsible.

206
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,283
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

207
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,451
Hot sake?

208
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,830
-Yes, two, please.
-No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

209
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,289
That's what I'm talking about.

210
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,417
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

211
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,253
you know what I recognise?

212
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:03,550
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

213
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,344
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out. . .

214
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,514
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

215
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,474
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

216
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,602
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

217
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,328
General.

218
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,957
Welcome, Mr Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

219
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,083
Thanks.

220
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,838
Is it better to be feared or respected?

221
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,049
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

222
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,928
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

223
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,805
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

224
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,931
It's the first missile system

225
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,851
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

226
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,897
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

227
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,982
I respectfully disagree.

228
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:05,069
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

229
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,531
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

230
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,451
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

231
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,869
Find an excuse

232
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,289
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

233
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,876
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

234
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:42,190
For your consideration, the Jericho.

235
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,786
I'll be throwing one of these in

236
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,871
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

237
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,039
To peace!

238
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,751
<i>-Tony.</i>
-Obie, what are you doing up?

239
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,337
<i>l couldn't sleep till l found out</i>
<i>how it went. How'd it go?</i>

240
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,255
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

241
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,218
<i>Hey! Way to go, my boy!</i>
<i>l'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

242
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,761
Why aren't you wearing those pyjamas
I got you?

243
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,429
<i>Good night, Tony.</i>

244
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,266
-Hey, Tony.
-I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

245
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:19,310
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

246
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,105
-Nice job.
-See you back at base.

247
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:31,299
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

248
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,670
What the hell did you do to me?

249
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,006
What I did?

250
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,051
What I did is to save your life.

251
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,971
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

252
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,848
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

253
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,351
Here, want to see?

254
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,854
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

255
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,734
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

256
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,237
We call them the walking dead

257
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,532
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

258
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,409
-What is this?
-That is an electromagnet,

259
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,287
hooked up to a car battery,

260
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,290
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

261
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,634
That's right. Smile.

262
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:02,473
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

263
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:05,560
-I don't remember.
-No, you wouldn't.

264
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,980
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

265
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,275
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

266
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,651
Where are we?

267
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,488
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

268
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,491
Just do as I do.

269
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,286
Come on, put your hands up.

270
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,455
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

271
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,958
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

272
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,649
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

273
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,526
"in the history of America."

274
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,489
He is honoured.

275
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,785
He wants you to build the missile.

276
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,497
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

277
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,252
This one.

278
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,383
I refuse.

279
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,103
<i>Tony!</i>

280
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,489
He wants to know what you think.

281
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,242
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

282
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:39,338
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

283
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,091
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

284
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,972
He says for you
to start working immediately,

285
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,309
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

286
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,356
-No, he won't.
-No, he won't.

287
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,539
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

288
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,709
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

289
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,048
Look, what you just saw,

290
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,967
that is your legacy, Stark.

291
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,972
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

292
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,350
Is that how you want to go out?

293
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:37,855
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

294
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,149
Or are you going to
do something about it?

295
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:45,363
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

296
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:48,699
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

297
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,117
Well, then,

298
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,829
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

299
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,127
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

300
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,422
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

301
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,758
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

302
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,844
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

303
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:24,610
-How many languages do you speak?
-A lot.

304
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,446
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

305
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,573
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

306
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:33,035
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

307
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:38,499
-Who are these people?
-They are your loyal customers, sir.

308
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,210
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

309
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:52,096
You know, we might be more productive

310
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,974
if you include me
in the planning process.

311
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,776
Okay, we don't need this.

312
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,155
What is that?

313
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,992
That's palladium, 0. 1 5 grammes.

314
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,079
We need at least 1 .6, so why don't
you go break down the other 1 1 ?

315
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,667
What's he doing?

316
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,544
Working.

317
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:36,599
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

318
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:39,351
Relax. I have steady hands.

319
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,855
Why do you think you're still alive?

320
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:52,531
-What do I call you?
-My name is Yinsen.

321
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,409
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

322
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,162
Nice to meet you, too.

323
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,496
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

324
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:44,041
That's because
it's a miniaturised arc reactor.

325
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,169
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

326
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,256
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

327
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,007
But what could it generate?

328
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:56,637
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

329
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,598
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

330
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,768
Yeah. Or something big for 1 5 minutes.

331
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:15,114
-This is our ticket out of here.
-What is it?

332
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,158
Flatten them out and look.

333
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:21,787
Oh, wow.

334
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,417
Impressive.

335
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,403
Good.

336
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,156
Good roll. Good roll.

337
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,825
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

338
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:02,703
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

339
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,248
-It's actually a nice place.
-Got a family?

340
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:10,961
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

341
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:13,339
And you, Stark?

342
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:19,678
-No.
-No?

343
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:24,016
So you're a man who has everything

344
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,101
and nothing.

345
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,817
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

346
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,402
Maybe it's been modified.

347
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,611
The tail is wrong.

348
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,737
It's just backwards.

349
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,701
Relax.

350
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:17,004
The bow and arrow

351
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,965
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

352
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,928
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

353
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,724
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

354
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:33,020
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

355
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:37,733
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

356
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,696
But today,

357
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:46,950
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

358
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,870
rules these lands.

359
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,540
And soon,

360
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,253
it will be my turn.

361
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,935
Why have you failed me?

362
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,479
We're working.

363
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,147
Diligently.

364
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:19,149
I let you live.

365
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,362
This is how you repay me?

366
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,365
It's very complex.

367
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,034
He's trying very hard.

368
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,410
On his knees.

369
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,750
You think I'm a fool?

370
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,836
I'll get the truth.

371
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,879
We're both working.

372
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:49,513
Open your mouth.

373
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:50,889
What does he want?

374
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,225
You think I'm a fool?

375
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,605
What's going on?

376
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,608
Tell me the truth.

377
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,318
He's building your Jericho.

378
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,782
What do you want? A delivery date?

379
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,416
I need him.

380
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,086
Good assistant.

381
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:29,928
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

382
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,079
Okay? Can you move?

383
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,414
Okay, say it again.

384
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,000
41 steps straight ahead. Then 1 6 steps,

385
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,545
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

386
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,513
Where is Stark?

387
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,765
He was here a moment ago.

388
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,975
Go look for him.

389
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,284
Yinsen ! Yinsen ! Stark!

390
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,412
Say something.
Say something back to him.

391
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,872
-He's speaking Hungarian. I don't. . .
-Then speak Hungarian.

392
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:23,417
-Okay. I know.
-What do you know?

393
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,859
-How'd that work?
-Oh, my goodness.

394
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,902
-It worked all right.
-That's what I do.

395
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,572
-Let me finish this.
-Initialise the power sequence.

396
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,990
Okay.

397
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,242
-Now!
-Tell me. Tell me.

398
00:33:57,326 --> 00:34:00,912
Function 1 1 .
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

399
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,581
-It should be up right now.
-Yes.

400
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,790
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

401
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,417
-I have it.
-Press Control "I".

402
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,919
-"I." Got it.
-"I." "Enter." "I" and "Enter."

403
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,755
Come over here and button me up.

404
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,967
Okay. All right.

405
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,385
Every other hex bolt.

406
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,596
-They're coming !
-Nothing pretty, just get it done.

407
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,056
-Just get it done.
-They're coming.

408
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,769
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

409
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,604
We need more time.

410
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,814
Hey,

411
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:31,902
-I'm gonna go buy you some time.
-Stick to the plan !

412
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:33,987
Stick to the plan !

413
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,157
Yinsen !

414
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,290
-Yinsen !
-Watch out!

415
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,556
Stark.

416
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,977
Come on. We got to go.

417
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,605
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

418
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,607
This was always the plan, Stark.

419
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,193
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

420
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,655
My family is dead.

421
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:06,700
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

422
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,620
It's okay.

423
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,667
I want this. I want this.

424
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,633
Thank you for saving me.

425
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:29,097
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

426
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,179
My turn.

427
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,741
Not bad.

428
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,025
Hey!

429
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,549
How was the "fun-vee"?

430
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,221
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

431
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,087
Watch it, coming up here.

432
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,175
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

433
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,812
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

434
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:50,483
-Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
-Yeah, vacation's over.

435
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,361
Where to, sir?

436
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,071
-Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
-No.

437
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:56,239
No? Tony, you have to

438
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:57,407
-go to the hospital.
-No is a complete answer.

439
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,367
-The doctor has to look at you.
-I don't have to do anything.

440
00:42:59,451 --> 00:43:00,910
I've been in captivity for three months.

441
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,747
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

442
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:05,873
-and the other. . .
-That's enough of that.

443
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,459
. . . is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

444
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:09,627
-Call for a press conference?
-Yeah.

445
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,255
-What on earth for?
-Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

446
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,477
Look at this!

447
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,522
Tony.

448
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,736
-We were going to meet at the hospital.
-No, I'm fine.

449
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,195
Look at you !

450
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,365
-You had to have a burger, yeah?
-Well, come on.

451
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:41,909
-You get me one of those?
-There's only one left. I need it.

452
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,707
Hey, look who's here! Yeah !

453
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,547
-Miss Potts?
-Yes.

454
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,882
Can I speak to you for a moment?

455
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:59,594
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

456
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,012
I'm not a reporter.

457
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,513
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

458
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:04,349
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

459
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,059
and Logistics Division.

460
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:08,853
-That's quite a mouthful.
-I know. We're working on it.

461
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:13,399
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA. . .

462
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:17,111
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

463
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,907
We need to debrief Mr Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

464
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:24,243
-I'll put something in the book, shall I?
-Thank you.

465
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,626
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

466
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:35,129
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can. . .

467
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:37,423
A little less formal and. . .

468
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,972
-What's up with the love-in?
-Don't look at me.

469
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:47,100
I don't know what he's up to.

470
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,602
-Good to see you.
-Good to see you.

471
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:52,105
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

472
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:55,108
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

473
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,196
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

474
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,324
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

475
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,704
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

476
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:12,917
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

477
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,382
I saw young Americans killed

478
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:24,303
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

479
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,098
And I saw

480
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:33,146
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

481
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,148
-Mr Stark!
-Hey, Ben.

482
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,900
What happened over there?

483
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:42,447
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realise that I have more

484
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:46,909
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

485
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:50,496
<i>And that is why, effective immediately,</i>
<i>l am shutting down</i>

486
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,208
<i>the weapons manufacturing division</i>
<i>of Stark InternationaI</i>

487
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:58,337
<i>untiI such a time as I can decide</i>
<i>what the future of the company will be.</i>

488
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,964
<i>l think we're gonna be selling</i>
<i>a lot of newspapers.</i>

489
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,883
<i>What direction it should take,</i>
<i>one that I'm comfortabIe with</i>

490
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:06,012
<i>and is consistent with the highest good</i>
<i>for this country, as well.</i>

491
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:12,059
<i>What we should take away from this</i>
<i>is that Tony's back!</i>

492
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:14,854
<i>And he's heaIthier than ever.</i>

493
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,357
<i>We're going to have</i>
<i>a IittIe internaI discussion</i>

494
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,818
<i>and we'll get back to you</i>
<i>with the follow-up.</i>

495
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:25,281
-Where is he?
-He's inside.

496
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,045
Well, that. . . That went well.

497
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:41,547
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

498
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,925
Your head? What about my head?

499
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:47,053
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

500
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:50,223
-Optimistically, 40 points.
-At minimum.

501
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,641
Yep.

502
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,228
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

503
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,939
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

504
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,650
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

505
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,901
It's my name on the side of the building.

506
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,570
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

507
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,614
Not based on what I saw.

508
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:08,908
We're not doing a good enough job.

509
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,201
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

510
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:13,162
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

511
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:17,416
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

512
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:21,838
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

513
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:25,299
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

514
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,511
-It works.
-Yeah, as a science project.

515
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:32,265
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

516
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,518
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

517
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,769
Maybe.

518
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:39,772
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

519
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,400
-Thirty years.
-That's what they say.

520
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,280
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

521
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,575
-Never mind who told me. Show me.
-It's Rhodey or Pepper.

522
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,952
-I want to see it.
-Okay, Rhodey.

523
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:02,879
-Okay.
-Okay?

524
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,425
It works.

525
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:15,641
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

526
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,978
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

527
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,479
like your father and I.

528
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,356
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

529
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:24,025
-But if I had. . .
-Tony.

530
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:27,153
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

531
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,947
-You understand me?
-That was Dad's line.

532
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,700
You gotta let me handle this.

533
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,202
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

534
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,121
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

535
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:40,458
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

536
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,501
<i>Stark Industries!</i>

537
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,421
<i>l've got one recommendation!</i>
<i>Ready? Ready?</i>

538
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,672
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

539
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,841
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

540
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,303
<i>Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?</i>

541
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,601
<i>Let me show you the new</i>
<i>Stark Industries business pIan!</i>

542
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:04,190
<i>Look, that's a weapons company</i>
<i>that doesn't make weapons!</i>

543
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,526
<i>Pepper. How big are your hands?</i>

544
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,279
-What?
<i>-How big are your hands?</i>

545
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,240
-I don't understand why. . .
<i>-Get down here. I need you.</i>

546
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,707
Hey.

547
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,253
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

548
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:27,380
Let's see them.

549
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,757
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

550
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,219
I just need your help for a sec.

551
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,222
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

552
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,849
It was. It is now an antique.

553
00:49:39,685 --> 00:49:42,478
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

554
00:49:42,562 --> 00:49:47,191
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

555
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,194
-Speed bump, what does that mean?
-It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

556
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:53,656
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

557
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:56,867
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

558
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,577
It's fine.

559
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,455
-What do you want me to do?
-Put that on the table over there.

560
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,290
-That is irrelevant.
-Oh, my God !

561
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:07,670
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

562
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,548
-Is it safe?
-Yeah, it should be fine.

563
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:12,258
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

564
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,718
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

565
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:16,262
-What do you mean, "Operation"?
-It's just a game, never mind.

566
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,391
-Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
-Okay.

567
00:50:22,227 --> 00:50:24,729
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

568
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:28,858
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

569
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,445
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

570
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,698
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm. . .

571
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:38,451
-Okay, okay.
-I really need your help here.

572
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,660
Okay.

573
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,583
Oh, there's pus!

574
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:50,296
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

575
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,298
-not from my body.
-It smells!

576
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,924
Yeah, it does.

577
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,969
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

578
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,179
-Okay, I got it! I got it!
-Okay, you got it?

579
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,182
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

580
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:02,308
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

581
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:03,684
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

582
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,936
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't. . .

583
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:08,939
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

584
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:10,191
-Oh, God !
-Okay, I was not expecting. . .

585
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:12,443
-Don't put it back in ! Don't put it back in !
-Okay, what do I do?

586
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:13,569
What's wrong?

587
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:14,820
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

588
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,155
'cause you yanked it out like a trout. . .

589
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:19,200
-What? You said it was safe!
-We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

590
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,285
-You gotta switch it out really quick.
-Okay. Okay.

591
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,412
-Tony? It's going to be okay.
-What?

592
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:24,538
-Is it?
-It's gonna be okay.

593
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,291
-I'm gonna make this okay.
-Let's hope.

594
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:31,837
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you. . .

595
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:39,470
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

596
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,680
Nice.

597
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:44,016
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I feel great.

598
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,351
You okay?

599
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:49,688
Don't ever, ever, ever,

600
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:52,775
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

601
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,985
I don't have anyone but you.

602
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,659
Anyway. . .

603
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,417
-What do you want me to do with this?
-That?

604
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,586
Destroy it.

605
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,630
Incinerate it.

606
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:16,924
You don't want to keep it?

607
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:21,178
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

608
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,432
-Will that be all, Mr Stark?
-That will be all, Miss Potts.

609
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,852
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

610
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,854
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

611
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:33,149
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

612
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:36,152
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

613
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:46,579
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

614
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:49,039
I'll tell you, in my experience,

615
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:53,878
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

616
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,504
his insight,

617
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,591
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

618
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:02,303
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgement.

619
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:05,389
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

620
00:53:05,473 --> 00:53:07,474
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr Tony Stark.

621
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,476
-Hello, sir.
-Speaking of manned or unmanned,

622
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,437
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

623
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,106
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1 987.

624
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:15,482
-That lovely lady you woke up with.
-Don't do that!

625
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,942
-What was his name?
-Don't do that.

626
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,110
-Was it Ivan?
-Don't do that.

627
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,445
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

628
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:20,696
-Okay.
-Don't do that.

629
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,741
-Pleasure meeting you.
-Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

630
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,329
-I'm surprised.
-Why?

631
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:31,123
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

632
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,083
I'm doing a little better than walking.

633
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,627
-Really?
-Yeah.

634
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,963
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

635
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,091
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

636
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,762
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

637
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,890
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

638
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,558
that was a doozy.

639
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:54,438
This is not for the military. I'm not. . .
It's different.

640
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,191
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

641
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:58,692
-I need you to listen to me.
-No.

642
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:02,655
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

643
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:06,116
-I'm serious.
-Okay.

644
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,247
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

645
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,498
Thanks.

646
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,134
-Jarvis, you up?
<i>-For you, sir, always.</i>

647
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:28,305
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark II.

648
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:33,185
<i>ShaII I store this on</i>
<i>the Stark Industries CentraI Database?</i>

649
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,896
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

650
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,816
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

651
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,610
<i>Working on a secret project,</i>
<i>are we, sir?</i>

652
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,659
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

653
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,289
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

654
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:39,251
Next. Up.

655
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,796
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

656
00:55:42,881 --> 00:55:44,965
Stay put. Nice.

657
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,596
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

658
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,223
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

659
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,315
Up.

660
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:03,984
Screw it. Don't even move.

661
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:07,112
You are a tragedy.

662
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,583
<i>Okay, Iet's do this right.</i>

663
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:23,087
<i>Start mark, half a metre,</i>
<i>and back and centre.</i>

664
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:28,050
<i>Dummy, look alive.</i>
<i>You're on standby for fire safety.</i>

665
00:56:28,134 --> 00:56:29,551
You, roll it.

666
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:35,432
<i>Okay. Activate hand controIs.</i>

667
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,938
<i>We're gonna start off nice and easy.</i>

668
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:44,191
<i>We're gonna see if</i>
<i>1 0% thrust capacity achieves lift.</i>

669
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,609
<i>And three,</i>

670
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,486
two,

671
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,446
<i>one.</i>

672
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,819
Up two. All right, set that.

673
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,321
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

674
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,240
Yeah, everything's. . . What?

675
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,491
-Obadiah's upstairs.
-Great!

676
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,577
-What would you like me to tell him?
-Great. I'll be right up.

677
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,287
Okay.

678
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,873
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

679
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:41,999
It is.

680
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:46,003
This is a flight stabiliser.
It's completely harmless.

681
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,300
I didn't expect that.

682
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,015
How'd it go?

683
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,935
It went that bad, huh?

684
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,688
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

685
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:08,650
-doesn't mean it went bad.
-Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

686
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,612
It would have gone better
if you were there.

687
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,405
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

688
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:18,035
-I lay low, and you take care of all. . .
-Hey, come on. In public. The press.

689
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:23,248
-This was a board of directors meeting.
-This was a board of directors meeting?

690
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,793
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

691
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,003
They're filing an injunction.

692
00:58:28,087 --> 00:58:30,130
-A what?
-They want to lock you out.

693
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,423
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

694
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,549
We knew that was gonna happen.

695
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,676
-Fifty-six and a half.
-It doesn't matter.

696
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,970
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

697
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,806
Tony, the board has rights, too.

698
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:44,561
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

699
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,897
-isn't in the company's best interest.
-I'm being responsible!

700
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,983
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

701
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:54,780
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that. . .

702
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:55,906
This is great.

703
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:59,451
-Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
-I'll be in the shop.

704
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,745
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

705
00:59:01,829 --> 00:59:05,165
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

706
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,833
Something to pitch them.

707
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,420
Let me have the engineers analyse that.
You know, draw up some specs.

708
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,631
-No. No, absolutely not.
-It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

709
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:14,299
-in New York!
-This one stays with me.

710
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,219
-That's it, Obie. Forget it.
-All right, well, this stays with me, then.

711
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,137
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

712
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,722
-Take two.
-Thank you.

713
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,683
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

714
00:59:22,767 --> 00:59:24,393
Good night, Obie.

715
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:29,856
Day 1 1 , test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

716
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:32,609
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

717
00:59:32,694 --> 00:59:35,529
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

718
00:59:35,613 --> 00:59:37,447
<i>All right, nice and easy.</i>

719
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:42,452
<i>SeriousIy, just gonna start off</i>
<i>with 1 % thrust capacity.</i>

720
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,081
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

721
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:58,927
Okay.

722
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,847
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

723
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:04,349
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

724
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,143
Just stand down !
If something happens, then come in.

725
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:08,478
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

726
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:10,147
Three, two, one.

727
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:29,333
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

728
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,751
Not the car, not the car!

729
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:33,128
Table!

730
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:48,310
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

731
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,913
No!

732
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,667
Yeah, I can fly.

733
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,383
-Jarvis, are you there?
<i>-At your service, sir.</i>

734
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:21,718
-Engage Heads Up Display.
<i>-Check.</i>

735
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,845
Import all preferences
from home interface.

736
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,389
<i>Will do, sir.</i>

737
01:01:32,313 --> 01:01:33,355
All right, what do you say?

738
01:01:33,439 --> 01:01:36,900
<i>l have indeed been uploaded, sir.</i>
<i>We're online and ready.</i>

739
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,652
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

740
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:41,738
<i>lmporting preferences</i>
<i>and calibrating virtual environment.</i>

741
01:01:41,823 --> 01:01:43,115
Do a check on control surfaces.

742
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,741
<i>As you wish.</i>

743
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,182
<i>Test complete. Preparing to</i>
<i>power down and begin diagnostics.</i>

744
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:12,185
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

745
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:13,770
Start listening in on ground control.

746
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:14,938
<i>Sir, there are stiII terabytes</i>

747
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,607
<i>of caIcuIations needed</i>
<i>before an actual flight is...</i>

748
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:21,611
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

749
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,991
Ready? In three, two, one.

750
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,099
Handles like a dream.

751
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:20,796
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

752
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,297
What's SR-71 's record?

753
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:26,176
<i>The altitude record for fixed wing flight</i>
<i>is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>

754
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:29,262
Records are made to be broken !
Come on !

755
01:03:32,433 --> 01:03:36,061
<i>Sir, there is a potentiaIIy fataI</i>
<i>buildup of ice occurring.</i>

756
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,229
Keep going !

757
01:03:39,524 --> 01:03:40,857
Higher!

758
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:58,792
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

759
01:04:01,546 --> 01:04:03,880
Come on, we got to break the ice!

760
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,417
Kill power.

761
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:08,004
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

762
01:06:08,089 --> 01:06:12,509
Hull pressurisation is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

763
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,844
<i>A very astute observation, sir.</i>

764
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:16,680
<i>Perhaps, if you intend</i>
<i>to visit other planets,</i>

765
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,223
<i>we should improve the exosystems.</i>

766
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,892
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

767
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:24,062
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

768
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:28,024
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

769
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,359
-Got it?
-Yes.

770
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:31,778
<i>ShaII I render</i>
<i>using proposed specifications?</i>

771
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:33,196
Thrill me.

772
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:39,160
<i>Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right</i>
<i>here at the Disney Concert HaII,</i>

773
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:43,498
<i>where Tony Stark's third annuaI benefit</i>
<i>for the Firefighter's Family Fund</i>

774
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,166
<i>has become the place to be</i>
<i>for L.A.'s high society.</i>

775
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,501
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

776
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:49,087
<i>l have no record of an invitation, sir.</i>

777
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,630
<i>...hasn't been seen in public</i>

778
01:06:50,715 --> 01:06:54,426
<i>since his bizarre and highly</i>
<i>controversial press conference.</i>

779
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:57,303
<i>Some cIaim he's suffering</i>
<i>from posttraumatic stress</i>

780
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:01,016
<i>and has been bedridden for weeks.</i>
<i>Whatever the case may be,</i>

781
01:07:01,475 --> 01:07:04,227
<i>no one expects an appearance</i>
<i>from him tonight.</i>

782
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:06,479
<i>The render is complete.</i>

783
01:07:06,564 --> 01:07:08,231
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

784
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:11,401
<i>What was l thinking?</i>
<i>You're usually so discreet.</i>

785
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,655
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

786
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:18,616
<i>Yes, that should help you</i>
<i>keep a low profile.</i>

787
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,705
<i>The render is complete.</i>

788
01:07:24,165 --> 01:07:26,082
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

789
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,751
<i>Commencing automated assembIy.</i>

790
01:07:27,835 --> 01:07:31,004
<i>Estimated completion time is five hours.</i>

791
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,130
Don't wait up for me, honey.

792
01:07:56,405 --> 01:08:00,158
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

793
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:03,995
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community. . .

794
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,167
-Hey, Tony, remember me?
-Sure don't.

795
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,170
You look great, Hef.

796
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,340
We're going to have a great quarter.

797
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:19,177
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

798
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:23,431
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

799
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,308
I'll see you inside.

800
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,104
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

801
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,939
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

802
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:34,651
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

803
01:08:39,156 --> 01:08:42,700
-Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
-Mr Stark?

804
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,161
-Yeah?
-Agent Coulson.

805
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,872
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the. . .

806
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51,292
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

807
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,002
God, you need a new name for that.

808
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:55,046
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

809
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,634
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

810
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,719
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

811
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,638
and time can be a factor
with these things.

812
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,807
Let's just put something on the books.

813
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:09,227
How about the 24th at 7:00 p. m.
at Stark Industries?

814
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,856
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

815
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:17,318
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

816
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:20,822
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognise you.

817
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,158
-What are you doing here?
-Just avoiding government agents.

818
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,076
-Are you by yourself?
-Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

819
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,995
-Oh, it was a birthday present.
-That's great.

820
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,164
-From you, actually.
-Well, I got great taste.

821
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,498
Yes.

822
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,500
-You want to dance?
-Oh, no.

823
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,086
-All right, come on.
-Thank you. No.

824
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,765
Am I making you uncomfortable?

825
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:53,438
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

826
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:57,358
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

827
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,195
-You look great and you smell great.
-Oh, God.

828
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:02,113
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

829
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,867
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

830
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:07,368
-I'd make it a week. Sure.
-Really?

831
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,954
What's your Social Security number?

832
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,210
-Five.
-Five?

833
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,378
-Right.
-Right.

834
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,797
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

835
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,051
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

836
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,733
-How about a little air?
-Yes, I need some air.

837
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,570
-That was totally weird.
-Totally harmless.

838
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,490
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

839
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,991
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

840
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,826
Everybody who I work with. . .
No, you know why?

841
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:52,080
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just. . . People. . . We just danced.

842
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:55,583
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

843
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,419
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

844
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,756
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

845
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,259
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

846
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,386
-and I'm dancing with you.
-I don't think it was taken that way.

847
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:09,264
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to. . .

848
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,349
-I just think you're overstating it.
-You know, and we're here,

849
01:11:11,433 --> 01:11:15,103
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

850
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,939
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and. . .

851
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:34,789
-I would like a drink, please.
-Got it, okay.

852
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,127
-I would like a vodka martini, please.
-Okay.

853
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:43,881
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

854
01:11:44,758 --> 01:11:47,802
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

855
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,054
Make one of them dirty, will you?

856
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,312
Wow. Tony Stark.

857
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,981
-Oh, hey.
-Fancy seeing you here.

858
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,028
-Carrie.
-Christine.

859
01:12:05,112 --> 01:12:06,154
That's right.

860
01:12:06,238 --> 01:12:08,865
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

861
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:10,325
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

862
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,869
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

863
01:12:12,953 --> 01:12:14,329
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

864
01:12:14,413 --> 01:12:15,747
involvement in this latest atrocity.

865
01:12:15,831 --> 01:12:18,624
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

866
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,835
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

867
01:12:20,919 --> 01:12:23,296
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

868
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,673
Is this what you call accountability?

869
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,509
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

870
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,482
-When were these taken?
-Yesterday.

871
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,984
-I didn't approve any shipment.
-Well, your company did.

872
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:47,028
Well, I'm not my company.

873
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:51,366
-Please, do you mind?
-Have you seen these pictures?

874
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,825
-What's going on in Gulmira?
-Tony, Tony.

875
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:56,204
-You can't afford to be this naive.
-You know what? I was naive before,

876
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,164
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

877
01:12:58,248 --> 01:12:59,624
"This is how we do business."

878
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,877
If we're double-dealing under the table. . .
Are we?

879
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:05,463
Tony, your picture, please!

880
01:13:07,716 --> 01:13:11,219
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

881
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:16,099
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

882
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:20,103
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

883
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:25,274
It was the only way I could protect you.

884
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:28,903
No. No.

885
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:41,249
<i>The 15-miIe hike to the outskirts</i>
<i>of GuImira can onIy be described</i>

886
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:45,002
<i>as a descent into hell,</i>
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

887
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:48,089
<i>SimpIe farmers and herders</i>
<i>from peaceful villages</i>

888
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,924
<i>have been driven from their homes,</i>

889
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:54,262
<i>displaced from their lands by warlords</i>
<i>emboldened by a new-found power.</i>

890
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:57,598
<i>Villagers have been forced to take</i>
<i>shelter in whatever crude dwellings</i>

891
01:13:57,683 --> 01:14:00,435
<i>they can find in the ruins</i>
<i>of other villages,</i>

892
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:04,397
<i>or here in the remnants</i>
<i>of an oId Soviet smeIting pIant.</i>

893
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,572
<i>Recent vioIence has been attributed</i>
<i>to a group of foreign fighters</i>

894
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:15,366
<i>referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.</i>

895
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:18,953
<i>As you can see, these men are</i>
<i>heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

896
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:23,166
<i>A mission that could prove fatal</i>
<i>to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

897
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,960
<i>With no political will</i>
<i>or international pressure,</i>

898
01:14:26,044 --> 01:14:28,463
<i>there's very little hope</i>
<i>for these refugees.</i>

899
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,841
<i>Around me, a woman begging for news</i>
<i>on her husband,</i>

900
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:33,718
<i>who was kidnapped by insurgents,</i>

901
01:14:33,802 --> 01:14:36,345
<i>either forced to join their militia...</i>

902
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,974
<i>Desperate refugees clutch</i>
<i>yellowed photographs,</i>

903
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,643
<i>holding them up to anyone</i>
<i>who will stop.</i>

904
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:46,355
<i>A child's simple question,</i>
<i>"Where are my mother and father?"</i>

905
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,401
<i>There's very little hope</i>
<i>for these refugees,</i>

906
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:54,322
<i>refugees who can only wonder who,</i>
<i>if anyone, will help.</i>

907
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,499
Hurry it up.

908
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:29,792
Put the women in the trucks.

909
01:16:29,876 --> 01:16:30,918
Stack the weapons here.

910
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,044
Clear all the houses.

911
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:33,796
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

912
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:42,972
Grab that dog.

913
01:16:45,892 --> 01:16:47,977
Put him with the others.

914
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,197
What the hell is this?

915
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,711
Shoot this dog.

916
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,463
You're all incompetent.

917
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,842
Turn your head.

918
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,327
<i>He's all yours.</i>

919
01:19:26,970 --> 01:19:28,846
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

920
01:19:28,930 --> 01:19:31,265
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

921
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,017
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

922
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:34,852
Get those monitors up!

923
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:36,270
We got a bogey!

924
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:38,481
-Wasn't Air Force!
-We got the CIA on the line?

925
01:19:38,565 --> 01:19:40,524
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

926
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,276
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

927
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,028
-It wasn't Navy.
-Wasn't Marines.

928
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,614
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

929
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:48,949
-Negative, negative.
-Cannot identify.

930
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,660
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

931
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,252
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

932
01:20:00,337 --> 01:20:02,046
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

933
01:20:02,130 --> 01:20:04,340
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

934
01:20:04,424 --> 01:20:06,133
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

935
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,885
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

936
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:09,303
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

937
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,388
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

938
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:13,641
-Is it stealth?
-No, sir, it's tiny.

939
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:16,101
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

940
01:20:16,186 --> 01:20:17,978
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

941
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:23,484
-Let me make a call.
-Sergeant, clear a hole.

942
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,864
-Hello?
-Tony?

943
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,658
<i>-Who's this?</i>
-It's Rhodes.

944
01:20:30,951 --> 01:20:32,993
-Sorry, hello?
<i>-I said it's Rhodes.</i>

945
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,996
-Speak up, please.
-What in the hell is that noise?

946
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,500
-Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
-Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

947
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:41,001
<i>lt's funny how that works, huh?</i>

948
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:44,463
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

949
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,173
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

950
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,925
<i>Well, that's a hot spot.</i>

951
01:20:48,009 --> 01:20:50,511
<i>Sounds Iike someone stepped in</i>
<i>and did your job for you, huh?</i>

952
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:51,679
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

953
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:52,972
<i>l'm not, l was just jogging in the canyon.</i>

954
01:20:53,056 --> 01:20:54,849
-I thought you were driving.
<i>-Right, l was driving</i>

955
01:20:54,933 --> 01:20:56,684
<i>to the canyon, where l'm going to jog.</i>

956
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:59,144
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

957
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,688
<i>-Nope!</i>
-Bogey spotted !

958
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,524
-Whiplash, come in hot.
-Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

959
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:07,027
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

960
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,446
That's my exit.

961
01:21:14,202 --> 01:21:17,621
<i>BaIIroom, this is WhipIash One.</i>
<i>l've got the bogey in my sights.</i>

962
01:21:17,831 --> 01:21:19,290
Whiplash One, what is it?

963
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:20,708
<i>l've got no idea.</i>

964
01:21:20,792 --> 01:21:23,127
-You have radio contact?
<i>-Non responsive, sir.</i>

965
01:21:23,211 --> 01:21:24,253
Then you are clear to engage.

966
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,339
<i>Hit it.</i>

967
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,139
<i>That bogey just went supersonic.</i>
<i>l got a lock!</i>

968
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,145
<i>-Inbound missiIe.</i>
-Flares!

969
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:46,775
<i>Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!</i>

970
01:22:01,082 --> 01:22:02,291
Deploy flaps!

971
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:04,752
Holy!

972
01:22:04,836 --> 01:22:06,420
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

973
01:22:06,504 --> 01:22:08,047
The sat visual has been lost.

974
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:09,798
<i>No way that's a UAV.</i>

975
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,008
What is it?

976
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:12,676
I can't see anything.

977
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,220
<i>Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.</i>

978
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:18,307
<i>l think bogey's been handled, sir.</i>

979
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,401
-Hello?
<i>-Hi, Rhodey, it's me.</i>

980
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,153
-It's who?
<i>-l'm sorry, it is me.</i>

981
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:32,529
<i>You asked.</i>
<i>What you were asking about is me.</i>

982
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,114
No, see, this isn't a game.

983
01:22:34,199 --> 01:22:37,493
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

984
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:39,495
-You understand that?
-This is not a piece of equipment.

985
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:42,373
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

986
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,875
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

987
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:49,463
<i>-Mark your position and return to base.</i>
<i>-Roger that, Ballroom.</i>

988
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,800
<i>On your beIIy!</i>

989
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:54,802
<i>It Iooks Iike a man!</i>

990
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,638
<i>Shake him off! RoII! RoII!</i>

991
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:06,855
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

992
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:09,233
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

993
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,364
<i>Punch out! Punch out!</i>

994
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,497
<i>WhipIash One down.</i>

995
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,165
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

996
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,501
<i>Negative! No chute, no chute!</i>

997
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,425
<i>My chute's jammed!</i>

998
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,766
<i>Sir, I've got a visuaI on the bogey.</i>

999
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:45,519
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1000
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,857
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1001
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:52,026
-Call off the Raptors.
-That thing just took out an F-22

1002
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,444
inside a legal no fly zone!

1003
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:55,863
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

1004
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:58,365
<i>You've been reengaged.</i>
<i>Execute evasive manoeuvre.</i>

1005
01:23:58,450 --> 01:23:59,783
Keep going !

1006
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,418
<i>Good chute! Good chute!</i>

1007
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:19,887
-Tony, you still there?
<i>-Hey, thanks.</i>

1008
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:22,556
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1009
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:24,808
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1010
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:29,063
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1011
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:30,814
<i>Now are you going to come by</i>
<i>and see what l'm working on?</i>

1012
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:33,734
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1013
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,402
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1014
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:37,988
<i>Training exercise.</i>
<i>Isn't that the usuaI BS?</i>

1015
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:39,656
<i>lt's not that simple.</i>

1016
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,409
An unfortunate training exercise

1017
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,412
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1018
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:49,500
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1019
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:53,504
<i>As for the unexpected turn of events</i>
<i>on the ground in GuImira,</i>

1020
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:57,091
<i>it is stiII uncIear</i>
<i>who or what intervened,</i>

1021
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:01,345
<i>but l can assure you that the United</i>
<i>States government was not invoIved.</i>

1022
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:04,473
Hey!

1023
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,268
<i>lt is a tight fit, sir.</i>

1024
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:12,106
<i>Sir, the more you struggIe,</i>
<i>the more this is going to hurt.</i>

1025
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,149
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1026
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:17,861
I designed this to come off, so. . . Hey.

1027
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,866
-I really should be able to. . .
<i>-Please, try not to move, sir.</i>

1028
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,703
What's going on here?

1029
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:35,337
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1030
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,798
Are those bullet holes?

1031
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,493
Welcome.

1032
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,957
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1033
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:16,545
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1034
01:26:16,629 --> 01:26:18,714
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1035
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:20,549
Show me the weapon.

1036
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:25,262
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1037
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,573
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1038
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:49,203
So this is how he did it.

1039
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,039
This is only a first, crude effort.

1040
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:54,541
Stark has perfected his design.

1041
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:57,502
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1042
01:26:58,171 --> 01:27:01,340
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1043
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,260
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1044
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,306
We have a common enemy.

1045
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,562
If we are still in business,

1046
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:20,317
I will give you these designs

1047
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:22,861
as a gift.

1048
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,906
And in turn,

1049
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:32,663
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1050
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:46,593
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1051
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:50,973
Technology.

1052
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:56,395
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1053
01:27:57,605 --> 01:28:00,774
Don't worry. It'll only last for 1 5 minutes.

1054
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,403
That's the least of your problems.

1055
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,286
Crate up the armour and the rest of it.

1056
01:28:13,913 --> 01:28:15,956
All right, let's finish up here.

1057
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,838
Set up Sector 1 6
underneath the arc reactor,

1058
01:28:22,922 --> 01:28:26,466
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1059
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,427
I want a prototype right away.

1060
01:28:36,602 --> 01:28:39,771
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1061
01:28:39,856 --> 01:28:42,065
I need you to go to my office.

1062
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:45,068
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1063
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,696
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1064
01:28:47,780 --> 01:28:49,364
This'll get you in.

1065
01:28:49,449 --> 01:28:51,033
It's probably under Executive Files.

1066
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,493
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1067
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,288
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1068
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:59,082
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1069
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:00,208
Same drill.

1070
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,377
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1071
01:29:02,462 --> 01:29:05,547
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1072
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:07,466
Tony,

1073
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,636
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1074
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,724
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1075
01:29:15,808 --> 01:29:19,394
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1076
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:22,856
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1077
01:29:23,983 --> 01:29:27,069
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1078
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,654
Is that so?

1079
01:29:31,824 --> 01:29:33,325
Well, then, I quit.

1080
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:37,996
You stood by my side all these years

1081
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:40,916
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1082
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,085
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1083
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:45,003
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1084
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:49,508
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1085
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:51,593
I shouldn't be alive,

1086
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,013
unless it was for a reason.

1087
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:57,724
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1088
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:01,395
I just finally know what I have to do.

1089
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,527
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1090
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,711
You're all I have, too, you know.

1091
01:31:36,282 --> 01:31:41,077
Sector 1 6?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1092
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:58,345
<i>You did not tell us that the target you</i>
<i>paid us to kiII was the great Tony Stark.</i>

1093
01:31:58,429 --> 01:31:59,971
<i>-As you can see, Obadiah Stane...</i>
-Oh, my God.

1094
01:32:00,056 --> 01:32:02,766
<i>...your deception and lies</i>
<i>will cost you dearly.</i>

1095
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,560
<i>The price to kiII Tony Stark</i>
<i>has just gone up.</i>

1096
01:32:09,565 --> 01:32:13,944
So, what are we going to do about this?

1097
01:32:25,957 --> 01:32:29,251
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1098
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:40,637
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1099
01:33:02,285 --> 01:33:06,663
I was so happy when he came home.

1100
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:09,541
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1101
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,546
Now I realise,

1102
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,135
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1103
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,556
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1104
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,935
Breaks my heart.

1105
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:35,191
Well, he's a complicated person.

1106
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:41,323
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1107
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:50,373
You are a very rare woman.

1108
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,045
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1109
01:33:57,798 --> 01:33:59,799
Thank you. Thanks.

1110
01:34:01,802 --> 01:34:03,845
I'd better get back there.

1111
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:11,353
Is that today's paper?

1112
01:34:12,980 --> 01:34:14,022
Yes.

1113
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,191
Do you mind?

1114
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,652
-Not at all.
-Puzzle.

1115
01:34:18,736 --> 01:34:20,028
Of course.

1116
01:34:23,532 --> 01:34:24,866
Take care.

1117
01:34:49,016 --> 01:34:51,893
Ms Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1118
01:34:51,977 --> 01:34:53,520
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1119
01:34:53,604 --> 01:34:54,729
-Right now?
-We're going to have it right now.

1120
01:34:54,814 --> 01:34:56,564
-Yeah, walk with me.
-Okay.

1121
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:59,859
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1122
01:35:01,487 --> 01:35:04,322
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1123
01:35:04,699 --> 01:35:08,243
Absolutely, we're. . .
I'm going to have to call you back.

1124
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:11,121
Mr Stane?
Sir, we've explored

1125
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:13,540
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1126
01:35:13,624 --> 01:35:15,250
-Actually. . .
-A hiccup?

1127
01:35:15,334 --> 01:35:19,129
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1128
01:35:19,338 --> 01:35:22,507
-So it's. . .
-Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1129
01:35:22,591 --> 01:35:28,555
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1130
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,642
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1131
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:39,315
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1132
01:35:41,527 --> 01:35:44,571
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1133
01:36:00,713 --> 01:36:01,796
<i>Tony?</i>

1134
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,761
<i>Tony, are you there? Hello?</i>

1135
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:10,555
Breathe.

1136
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:14,434
Easy, easy.

1137
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,813
You remember this one, right?

1138
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:22,859
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1139
01:36:22,943 --> 01:36:27,071
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1140
01:36:29,408 --> 01:36:30,658
Tony.

1141
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:37,332
When I ordered the hit on you,

1142
01:36:39,960 --> 01:36:42,462
I worried that I was

1143
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,550
killing the golden goose.

1144
01:36:48,886 --> 01:36:52,639
But, you see, it was just

1145
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:56,226
fate that you survived that.

1146
01:37:01,315 --> 01:37:05,151
You had one last golden egg to give.

1147
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:14,661
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1148
01:37:18,582 --> 01:37:23,670
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1149
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:28,007
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1150
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,686
Oh, it's beautiful.

1151
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:47,110
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1152
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:51,865
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1153
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:55,034
This is your legacy.

1154
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:02,792
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1155
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:09,716
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1156
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:12,051
put the balance of power in our hands.

1157
01:38:13,637 --> 01:38:15,221
The right hands.

1158
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:22,896
I wish you could see my prototype.

1159
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:25,815
It's not as. . .

1160
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,153
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1161
01:38:32,197 --> 01:38:35,033
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1162
01:38:35,492 --> 01:38:38,036
I would have preferred that she lived.

1163
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:53,384
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1164
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:56,054
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah. . .

1165
01:38:57,348 --> 01:38:58,598
Okay, where's Tony now?

1166
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:00,391
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1167
01:39:00,517 --> 01:39:02,644
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1168
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:05,355
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1169
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:12,964
Good boy.

1170
01:40:52,796 --> 01:41:03,765
Tony?

1171
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:07,477
Tony!

1172
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:11,981
Tony! You okay?

1173
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,985
-Where's Pepper?
-She's fine. She's with five agents.

1174
01:41:16,111 --> 01:41:18,362
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1175
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,656
That's not going to be enough.

1176
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:50,478
Section 1 6. Section 1 6. There it is.

1177
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:02,156
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1178
01:42:02,241 --> 01:42:04,367
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1179
01:42:04,493 --> 01:42:05,868
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1180
01:42:05,994 --> 01:42:08,704
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1181
01:42:27,307 --> 01:42:29,809
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1182
01:42:29,893 --> 01:42:32,728
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1183
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:41,737
You need me to do anything else?

1184
01:42:42,364 --> 01:42:44,157
<i>Keep the skies clear.</i>

1185
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:50,580
Damn !

1186
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,256
Next time, baby.

1187
01:43:30,412 --> 01:43:33,789
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1188
01:43:34,374 --> 01:43:36,375
I thought it'd be bigger.

1189
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:22,255
Take him out!

1190
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:35,101
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

1191
01:44:35,185 --> 01:44:37,520
<i>The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.</i>

1192
01:44:37,604 --> 01:44:40,273
<i>That chest piece</i>
<i>was never designed for sustained flight.</i>

1193
01:44:40,357 --> 01:44:41,857
Keep me posted.

1194
01:44:43,652 --> 01:44:44,694
<i>Pepper!</i>

1195
01:44:44,778 --> 01:44:47,697
-Tony! Tony, are you okay?
<i>-I'm fine. How are...</i>

1196
01:44:47,823 --> 01:44:49,699
-Obadiah, he's gone insane!
<i>-I know.</i>

1197
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,617
<i>-Listen, you'd better get out of there.</i>
-He built a suit.

1198
01:44:51,702 --> 01:44:53,160
<i>Get out of there right now!</i>

1199
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:07,341
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1200
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:15,850
<i>Your services are no longer required.</i>

1201
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:17,518
<i>Stane!</i>

1202
01:45:42,711 --> 01:45:44,420
<i>I Iove this suit!</i>

1203
01:45:44,504 --> 01:45:47,715
<i>-Put them down!</i>
<i>-CoIIateraI damage, Tony.</i>

1204
01:45:49,259 --> 01:45:51,302
Divert power to chest RT.

1205
01:46:00,020 --> 01:46:02,146
<i>Power reduced to 1 9%.</i>

1206
01:46:09,988 --> 01:46:11,113
<i>Lady!</i>

1207
01:46:12,991 --> 01:46:15,034
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

1208
01:46:37,099 --> 01:46:40,059
<i>For 30 years, l've been holding you up!</i>

1209
01:46:44,523 --> 01:46:46,982
<i>l built this company from nothing!</i>

1210
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,821
<i>Nothing is going to stand in my way.</i>

1211
01:46:58,036 --> 01:47:00,496
<i>Least of all you!</i>

1212
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:13,300
<i>lmpressive!</i>
<i>You've upgraded your armour!</i>

1213
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:16,595
<i>l've made some upgrades of my own!</i>

1214
01:47:24,938 --> 01:47:26,897
<i>Sir, it appears that his suit can fIy.</i>

1215
01:47:26,982 --> 01:47:28,691
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1216
01:47:28,775 --> 01:47:31,026
<i>With only 1 5% power,</i>
<i>the odds of reaching that...</i>

1217
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:33,279
I know the math ! Do it!

1218
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,873
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1219
01:47:43,957 --> 01:47:46,584
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1220
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:52,298
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1221
01:47:52,382 --> 01:47:53,632
Yes, sir.

1222
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:03,517
<i>-Thirteen percent power, sir.</i>
-Climb!

1223
01:48:07,522 --> 01:48:09,565
<i>-Eleven percent.</i>
-Keep going !

1224
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:18,407
<i>-Seven percent power.</i>
-Just leave it on the screen !

1225
01:48:18,492 --> 01:48:20,075
Stop telling me!

1226
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:34,381
<i>You had a great idea, Tony, but my</i>
<i>suit is more advanced in every way!</i>

1227
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:37,009
<i>How'd you solve the icing problem?</i>

1228
01:48:37,093 --> 01:48:38,594
Icing problem?

1229
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:43,098
<i>Might want to look into it.</i>

1230
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:56,111
<i>Two percent.</i>

1231
01:48:58,281 --> 01:49:01,116
<i>We are now running</i>
<i>on emergency backup power.</i>

1232
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:16,215
-Potts!
-Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1233
01:49:16,299 --> 01:49:20,469
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1234
01:49:20,554 --> 01:49:21,971
<i>Nice try!</i>

1235
01:49:34,484 --> 01:49:38,737
-Weapons status?
<i>-Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.</i>

1236
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:44,493
Flares!

1237
01:49:53,003 --> 01:49:55,004
<i>Very clever, Tony.</i>

1238
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:02,845
-Potts?
-Tony!

1239
01:50:02,929 --> 01:50:03,929
This isn't working.

1240
01:50:04,014 --> 01:50:06,265
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1241
01:50:06,349 --> 01:50:09,268
-Well, how are you going to do that?
-You're going to do it.

1242
01:50:09,352 --> 01:50:11,770
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1243
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:13,272
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1244
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:15,941
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1245
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:17,443
It's going to fry everything up here.

1246
01:50:19,613 --> 01:50:21,864
Okay. I'm going in now.

1247
01:50:21,990 --> 01:50:25,200
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1248
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:36,545
<i>This looks important!</i>

1249
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,235
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1250
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:04,406
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1251
01:51:12,707 --> 01:51:15,209
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1252
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:19,713
You'd have made your father proud !

1253
01:51:24,678 --> 01:51:27,179
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1254
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:48,033
Tony!

1255
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:50,869
How ironic, Tony!

1256
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:57,584
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1257
01:51:57,794 --> 01:52:03,716
-Pepper!
-And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1258
01:52:06,761 --> 01:52:10,556
-You ripped out my targeting system !
-Time to hit the button !

1259
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:14,643
-You told me not to!
-Hold still, you little prick!

1260
01:52:16,730 --> 01:52:19,273
-Just do it!
-You'll die!

1261
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:23,902
Push it!

1262
01:53:21,461 --> 01:53:23,212
Tony!

1263
01:53:31,721 --> 01:53:33,806
<i>You've aII received the officiaI</i>
<i>statement of what occurred</i>

1264
01:53:33,890 --> 01:53:36,183
<i>at Stark Industries Iast night.</i>

1265
01:53:36,518 --> 01:53:41,021
<i>There have been unconfirmed reports</i>
<i>that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</i>

1266
01:53:41,147 --> 01:53:43,732
<i>and caused damage to the arc reactor.</i>

1267
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,735
<i>Fortunately, a member</i>
<i>of Tony Stark's personaI security staff...</i>

1268
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,737
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1269
01:53:48,863 --> 01:53:52,491
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1270
01:53:52,575 --> 01:53:55,160
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1271
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:56,912
Here's your alibi.

1272
01:53:57,747 --> 01:53:58,831
Okay.

1273
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:01,083
-You were on your yacht.
-Yeah.

1274
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:03,335
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1275
01:54:03,419 --> 01:54:05,087
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1276
01:54:05,213 --> 01:54:08,340
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1277
01:54:08,424 --> 01:54:10,217
alone on the island.

1278
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:12,761
-That's what happened.
-All right.

1279
01:54:12,887 --> 01:54:15,013
Just read it, word for word.

1280
01:54:16,891 --> 01:54:18,934
There's nothing about Stane here.

1281
01:54:19,018 --> 01:54:21,770
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1282
01:54:22,689 --> 01:54:25,107
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1283
01:54:25,233 --> 01:54:27,693
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1284
01:54:27,777 --> 01:54:30,696
He's my. . . I mean, is that. . .
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1285
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:33,115
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr Stark.

1286
01:54:33,199 --> 01:54:37,202
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1287
01:54:37,287 --> 01:54:39,538
You've got 90 seconds.

1288
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:44,084
Agent Coulson?

1289
01:54:44,752 --> 01:54:49,214
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1290
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:52,259
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1291
01:54:52,468 --> 01:54:55,888
-From the Strategic Homeland. . .
-Just call us S. H . I. E. L. D.

1292
01:54:56,222 --> 01:54:57,389
Right.

1293
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:02,227
-Let's get this show on the road.
-You know, it's actually not that bad.

1294
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,605
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1295
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:06,231
-You're not Iron Man.
-Am so.

1296
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:08,775
-You're not.
-All right, suit yourself.

1297
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:12,863
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1298
01:55:12,989 --> 01:55:15,616
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1299
01:55:15,700 --> 01:55:17,951
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1300
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:21,788
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1301
01:55:23,499 --> 01:55:24,541
crazy about me.

1302
01:55:24,667 --> 01:55:26,293
Tell me you never think about that night.

1303
01:55:26,377 --> 01:55:28,295
-What night?
-You know.

1304
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:36,970
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1305
01:55:38,640 --> 01:55:44,186
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1306
01:55:44,312 --> 01:55:47,522
and you left me there, by myself?

1307
01:55:48,733 --> 01:55:51,318
Is that the night you're talking about?

1308
01:55:53,488 --> 01:55:54,529
Thought so.

1309
01:55:57,241 --> 01:56:00,994
-Will that be all, Mr Stark?
-Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1310
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:04,623
<i>And now, Mr Stark has</i>
<i>prepared a statement.</i>

1311
01:56:04,707 --> 01:56:07,751
<i>He will not be taking any questions.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

1312
01:56:11,923 --> 01:56:17,052
<i>Been a while since l was in front of you.</i>
<i>l figure l'll stick to the cards this time.</i>

1313
01:56:19,055 --> 01:56:22,057
<i>There's been speculation that l was</i>
<i>invoIved in the events that occurred</i>

1314
01:56:22,183 --> 01:56:23,433
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

1315
01:56:23,559 --> 01:56:26,311
I'm sorry, Mr Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1316
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:30,148
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1317
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,360
-despite the fact that you. . .
<i>-l know that it's confusing.</i>

1318
01:56:33,444 --> 01:56:37,030
<i>lt is one thing to question the official</i>
<i>story, and another thing entirely</i>

1319
01:56:37,115 --> 01:56:40,367
<i>to make wild accusations,</i>
<i>or insinuate that l'm a superhero.</i>

1320
01:56:40,451 --> 01:56:42,077
I never said you were a superhero.

1321
01:56:42,203 --> 01:56:47,541
<i>Didn't? Well, good, because that would</i>
<i>be outIandish and fantastic.</i>

1322
01:56:49,544 --> 01:56:52,754
<i>I'm just not the hero type. CIearIy.</i>

1323
01:56:53,297 --> 01:56:56,258
<i>With this laundry list</i>
<i>of character defects,</i>

1324
01:56:56,384 --> 01:56:57,801
<i>all the mistakes l've made,</i>

1325
01:56:57,927 --> 01:57:01,221
<i>-largely public.</i>
-Just stick to the cards, man.

1326
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:02,973
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1327
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:06,601
<i>The truth is</i>

1328
01:57:12,775 --> 01:57:14,276
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1329
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:18,760
Jarvis!

1330
02:05:18,844 --> 02:05:20,595
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

1331
02:05:24,016 --> 02:05:29,521
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1332
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:33,107
Mr Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1333
02:05:33,192 --> 02:05:34,984
You just don't know it yet.

1334
02:05:35,486 --> 02:05:37,278
Who the hell are you?

1335
02:05:37,488 --> 02:05:40,198
Nick Fury, Director of S. H . I. E. L. D.

1336
02:05:42,284 --> 02:05:45,245
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.

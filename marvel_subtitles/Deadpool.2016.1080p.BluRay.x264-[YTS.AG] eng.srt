00:44:04,277 --> 00:44:07,344
Thanks! Thank you. Thank you.

887
00:44:07,346 --> 00:44:10,080
You have something
in your teeth.

888
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:12,283
Right in the middle there.
Just, I don't...

889
00:44:12,285 --> 00:44:15,386

lettuce or something.

894
00:44:22,395 --> 00:44:24,161
Hey, is Ajax
your actual name?

895
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:25,996
Because it sounds
suspiciously made up.

896
00:44:25,998 --> 00:44:27,131
What is it, really?

897
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,400

Is it Basil Fawlty?

900
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:35,539
Oh, joke away.

901
00:44:35,541 --> 00:44:37,041
One thing that never
survives this place

902
00:44:37,043 --> 00:44:39,043
is a sense of humor.

903
00:44:39,045 --> 00:44:40,210

to me right after.

929

would involve public nudity.

I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

round-the-clock torture...

961
00:47:23,209 --> 00:47:26,243
is that you can't really
step it up from there.

00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:31,215
Is that what you think?

963

If this doesn't unlock
your mutation, then, well...

964
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:41,425
nothing will.

965
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:42,943
Now, what we're going to do is

966
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,460
lower the oxygen
concentration in the air...

967
00:47:44,463 --> 00:47:47,364
to the exact point you feel
like you're suffocating.

968
00:47:47,366 --> 00:47:48,632
If your brainwaves slow,

969
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:51,235
meaning you're
about to pass out...

970
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:52,436
then we'll turn up the O2.

971
00:47:53,372 --> 00:47:54,771
If your heart rate slows...

972
00:47:54,773 --> 00:47:57,574
meaning you're able
to catch your breath...

973
00:47:57,576 --> 00:47:59,576
we'll turn it back down.

974
00:47:59,578 --> 00:48:01,245

we'll leave you.

you a superhero.

01:36:32,355 --> 01:36:34,455
I'm sorry for not
cowboying up sooner.

1764
01:36:34,457 --> 01:36:36,290
It's been rough
couple of years.

1765
01:36:36,292 --> 01:36:37,358
Rough?

1766
01:36:45,134 --> 01:36:47,068
I live in a crackhouse.

1767
01:36:48,204 --> 01:36:49,537
With a family of 12.

1768
01:36:51,274 --> 01:36:52,740
Every night
we spoon for warmth.

1769
01:36:52,742 --> 01:36:55,810
Everybody fights for Noelle.
She's the fattest.

1770
01:36:55,812 --> 01:36:57,578
There's nothing
that we don't share.

1771
01:36:57,580 --> 01:37:01,782
Floor space, dental floss,
even condoms.

1772
01:37:09,792 --> 01:37:12,193
So, you live in a house.

1773
01:37:20,803 --> 01:37:23,838
I should have come
and found you sooner.

1774
01:37:25,341 --> 01:37:26,674
But, baby,
the guy under this mask,

1775
01:37:26,676 --> 01:37:29,376
he ain't the same one
that you remember.

1776
01:37:33,616 --> 01:37:34,849
You mean this mask?

1777
01:37:54,904 --> 01:37:56,637
And this one.

1778
01:37:58,141 --> 01:37:59,840
In case the other fell off.

1779
01:38:02,745 --> 01:38:05,212
All right.
Yeah, just... Ow.

1780
01:38:05,214 --> 01:38:06,814
Like a Band-Aid,
just give it a...

1781
01:38:06,816 --> 01:38:09,150
Owdie 5,000.

1782
01:38:09,152 --> 01:38:10,284
Wait, wait, wait...

1783
01:38:12,155 --> 01:38:13,420
Are you sure?

1784
01:38:15,258 --> 01:38:16,323
I'm sure.

1785
01:38:26,536 --> 01:38:27,601
Wow.

1786
01:38:28,838 --> 01:38:30,204
Yeah.

1787
01:38:36,879 --> 01:38:38,412
Hey.

1788
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:42,783
After a brief
adjustment period...

1789
01:38:42,785 --> 01:38:44,785
and a bunch of drinks...

1790
01:38:46,255 --> 01:38:48,289
it's a face...

1791
01:38:52,595 --> 01:38:54,361
I'd be happy to sit on.

1792
01:39:01,671 --> 01:39:05,306
I'm not the same
underneath this suit, either.

1793
01:39:05,308 --> 01:39:06,740
No.

1794
01:39:06,742 --> 01:39:08,742
Super-penis.

1795
01:39:08,744 --> 01:39:10,844
COLOSSUS:
Come on, Wade. Language.

1796
01:39:10,846 --> 01:39:12,413
Young one is present.

1797
01:39:13,416 --> 01:39:15,349
What are you still doing?

1798
01:39:15,351 --> 01:39:17,952
Get out of here.
Go make yourself useful!

1799
01:39:17,954 --> 01:39:20,821
You, go be a really
big brother to someone.

1800
01:39:20,823 --> 01:39:22,656
Tell Beast to stop
shitting on my lawn.

1801
01:39:22,658 --> 01:39:24,625
And you,
chicken noodle...

1802
01:39:24,627 --> 01:39:26,527
Nothing compares to you.

1803
01:39:26,529 --> 01:39:28,629
Sinead O'Connor, 1990.
Sorry.

1804
01:39:28,631 --> 01:39:31,465
That's all right.
You're cool.

1805
01:39:31,467 --> 01:39:32,666
(GASPS)

1806
01:39:33,336 --> 01:39:34,935
What in the ass?

1807
01:39:34,937 --> 01:39:38,505
That was not mean.
I'm proud of you!

1808
01:39:38,507 --> 01:39:41,675
We will make an X-Man
of you yet, Wade.

1809
01:39:41,677 --> 01:39:42,977
For a second there,

1810
01:39:42,979 --> 01:39:44,812
it felt like we were
three mini-lion robots...

1811
01:39:44,814 --> 01:39:47,248
coming together to form
one super robot.

1812
01:39:47,883 --> 01:39:49,283
There's a stupid.

1813
01:39:49,285 --> 01:39:50,384
Yeah.

1814
01:39:53,689 --> 01:39:58,259
And now, for the moment
I've all been waiting for.

1815
01:40:01,797 --> 01:40:02,963
Come here.

It's over. Go home.

1835
01:47:16,765 --> 01:47:19,232
Oh, you're expecting
a teaser for <i>Deadpool 2.</i>

1836
01:47:19,234 --> 01:47:22,069
Well, we don't have
that kind of money.

1837
01:47:22,071 --> 01:47:25,105
What are you expecting?
Sam Jackson to show up?

1838
01:47:25,107 --> 01:47:27,874
With an eye patch and a saucy
little leather number?

1839

Go. Go.

01:47:34,783 --> 01:47:36,550
Oh.

1841
01:47:36,551 --> 01:47:38,318
But I can tell you one thing,
and it's a bit of a secret.

1842
01:47:38,320 --> 01:47:41,488
For the sequel,
we're gonna have Cable.

1843
01:47:41,490 --> 01:47:44,057
Amazing character.
Bionic arm, time travel.

who we're gonna cast yet,

She's got range. Who knows.

Anyway, big secret. Shh...

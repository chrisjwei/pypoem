1
00:01:05,691 --> 00:01:09,694
Typical of Victor Von Doom to build
a 30-foot statue of himself.

2
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,280
Well, it's obviously aimed
at first-time visitors

3
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:15,700
to create feelings
of smallness, inadequacy.

4
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,870
Good thing it ain't working.

5
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:23,458
Reed, what are we doing here?
This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science.

6
00:01:23,584 --> 00:01:25,835
This wasn't our first stop,
in case you forgot.

7
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:30,214
Besides, Victor's not that bad.
He's just a little larger than life.

8
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,852
My research suggests that exposure
to a high-energy cosmic storm

9
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:47,523
borne on solar winds might have triggered
the evolution of early planetary life.

10
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:52,945
In six weeks, another cloud
with the same elemental profile

11
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,822
will pass Earth's orbit.

12
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:59,869
A study conducted in space could
fundamentally advance our knowledge

13
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:03,289
about the structure of the human genome,
cure countless diseases,

14
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:07,627
extend human life, give kids a chance
to live longer, stronger, healthier...

15
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,796
Turn it off, please.

16
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,256
l don't think l have explained
my proposal fully.

17
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,091
No, l think you have.

18
00:02:14,218 --> 00:02:16,803
Same old Reed, always stretching,
reaching for the stars

19
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,347
with the weight of the world on his back.

20
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,599
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?

21
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,855
You remember, when we were in school
we talked about working together.

22
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,399
Well, that's what l was about to explain.

23
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:33,152
The storm is deadly.

24
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:35,279
But the shields on
your station's control room

25
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:37,949
are designed to protect
any occupants inside.

26
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,287
So, it's not just my money you want.

27
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,039
lt's my toys.

28
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,502
Tell me, if NASA doesn't trust you,
then why should l?

29
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:55,967
That's my job, to stay a step ahead.

30
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:59,929
To know what other men don't.

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,472
l can't take this.

32
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,641
Ben, this is business, just work.

33
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:06,227
He's right, Ben. lt is just business.

34
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:11,399
l think you both know my Director
of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

35
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,988
One more thing he's got.

36
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:19,448
-Hey, Susie.
-Hey.

37
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,827
lt's so nice to see you. How's Debbie?

38
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,370
-Great.
-Great.

39
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:29,125
-How have you been?
-Never better.

40
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,629
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?

41
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:34,964
-No.
-Not at all.

42
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,257
Good.

43
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:40,469
Then you're just in time
to hear the great Reed Richards

44
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,847
ask me for help.

45
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:47,602
You know, you made a lot of folks at MlT
feel like a junior high science fair.

46
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:50,396
So you'll excuse me
if l savor the moment.

47
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:55,651
You back this mission and I'll sign over
a fair percentage of any application...

48
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:57,069
The number's 75%.

49
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,155
And its applications and patents.

50
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,365
-What about his first born?
-Ben...

51
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:03,367
Come on.

52
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:07,705
25% of a billion is enough
to keep the lights on for a while, isn't it?

53
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:11,584
Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage
on the Baxter Building.

54
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,211
Deal?

55
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:25,348
Well, then. To our future.

56
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,143
Together!

57
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,522
lt's funny how things turn out, isn't it?

58
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,733
Hilarious.

59
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:42,114
He knew about NASA.
Maybe he made the call to shut us down.

60
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:45,534
Ben, think about all the people
we can help if this works.

61
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:48,329
Look, we got what we wanted.
That's enough.

62
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,332
A few days in space, it'll be great.
What's the worst that can happen?

63
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,840
If Reed's right, this little trip
could double our stock offerings.

64
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:02,259
-And if he's not...
-Reed's always right.

65
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,846
Good thing he doesn't always know
what he's got.

66
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:18,067
Reed, you should know those solar winds
have been picking up speed.

67
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,860
l factored them into my coordinates.

68
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:22,405
Right, of course you did. In theory.

69
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,407
lt's a little different once you're out there.

70
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,742
-l assure you l...
-When are we leaving?

71
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,246
I'll be scheduling the launch,

72
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,416
so you can call me in the morning
for resources and crew.

73
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:36,919
-l think l remember the number.
-lt's been changed.

74
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,512
As far as crew, l was hoping
Ben could pilot the mission.

75
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,099
We already have a pilot on our payroll
but you're welcome to ride shotgun.

76
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,018
Remember my brother, Johnny?

77
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:11,454
Can't do it. Cannot do it.

78
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,374
External SRBs, orbital system engines,
it's just like the shuttle you flew.

79
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,461
No! l cannot take orders
from the underwear model.

80
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:20,963
-Come on now, Ben.
-That wingnut washed out of NASA

81
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:24,717
for sneaking two Victoria's Secret
wannabes into a flight simulator.

82
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:26,302
Youthful high spirits.

83
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:30,139
They crashed it into a wall.
A flight simulator.

84
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:32,391
When have l ever asked you
to do something

85
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,060
you absolutely said you could not do?

86
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,311
Five times.

87
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,606
-l had it at four.
-Well, this makes five.

88
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,409
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

89
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,579
<i>Commencing launch sequence</i>
<i>in six hours.</i>

90
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,498
l miss you already, Debs.

91
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,333
Captain on the bridge!

92
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,964
Digital camera: $254. Memory stick: $59.

93
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:07,259
The look on your hard-ass
former CO's face

94
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:09,845
when he finds out he's your junior officer:

95
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,597
Priceless.

96
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:15,851
Thank you. That's so sweet.

97
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,770
l can handle the ship.

98
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,189
l can even handle Mr. Blond Ambition.

99
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:23,776
But l don't know whether l should be
flying or doing Swan Lake in these suits.

100
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,862
-l mean, who the hell came up with these?
-Victor did.

101
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:31,367
The synthetics act as a second skin,
adapting to your body's individual needs.

102
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,370
See, now that means
it keeps the hot stuff hot

103
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:36,539
and it keeps the cool stuff cool.

104
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,333
Wow. Fantastic.

105
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,003
Material made from self-regulating
unstable molecules.

106
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,507
I've been working on a formula for this.

107
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:49,301
Great minds think alike.

108
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,807
-Here you go, Ben.
-Thanks, sweetie.

109
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,058
Reed.

110
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,385
ETA until cosmic event: nine hours.

111
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:34,597
If you're good, maybe next time
Daddy'll let you drive.

112
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,433
You keep talking
and there won't be a next time.

113
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:44,440
Long way from the projection booth
at the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?

114
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,113
Yes. Yes, it is.

115
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:56,452
We can monitor the cloud's approach
and observe the tests from here.

116
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:58,495
ls it safe?

117
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,624
The shields on the station
should protect us.

118
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,125
Should?

119
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,754
What's the matter, Ben?
Getting paranoid in your old age?

120
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:11,133
Let's start loading those samples.
Get your suit ready, Ben.

121
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:15,512
So l see you're still doing
all the heavy lifting.

122
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:19,892
Maybe you should have stayed in the lab.
Field work never suited you.

123
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,395
He does the talking, l do the walking.
Got it?

124
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,190
So take a walk, Ben.

125
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:31,362
Actually, if you'll all excuse me,
l need to borrow Susan for a moment.

126
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,034
Sure.

127
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,415
Please tell me your guy's not trying
to rekindle things with my sister again.

128
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,834
Of course not. lt's strictly business.

129
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,754
Yes, well, his eyes say differently,
don't they?

130
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:54,093
Two hearts got busted last time.
Maybe she's not over it, either.

131
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:57,680
Wow, Dr. Phil, that's deep.
Let's think about that.

132
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,392
You got Victor, more money than God,
stud of the year.

133
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:06,855
And you got Reed, world's dumbest smart
guy, worth less than a postage stamp.

134
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:08,941
That's a real toss-up.

135
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:11,193
Don't trouble your tiny little mind.

136
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,445
Don't wander off now, boy.

137
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,908
<i>Securing airlock chamber.</i>

138
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,847
Surprised l agreed to Reed's proposal?

139
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:42,057
l understand the business reasons.

140
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,811
Well, when you're looking at your future

141
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,564
it doesn't hurt
to find closure about the past.

142
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:54,987
Susan, every man dreams he'll meet
a woman he can give the world to.

143
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,116
In my case, it's not just a metaphor.

144
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,332
<i>Opening viewing station shield.</i>

145
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:37,863
That can't be right.

146
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:43,702
<i>Event threshold</i>
<i>in T-minus 9 minutes, 47 seconds.</i>

147
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,663
That's impossible.
lt should be seven hours.

148
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,587
We've been together two years now.

149
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,424
lt's been a good two years, Victor.
The company's accomplished so much.

150
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,551
Right, of course, the company.

151
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:04,848
But, you see, I've come to realize that
all the accomplishments in the world

152
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,975
mean nothing without someone
to share them with.

153
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,979
I've lived my life
unafraid of taking big steps.

154
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:14,274
Now it's time to take the biggest step
of all.

155
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:18,904
-Victor.
-If it helps, think of this as a promotion.

156
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,324
-Victor, l...
-l have four words.

157
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,912
Four little words that can change
our lives forever.

158
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,997
The cloud is accelerating.

159
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,875
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours.

160
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,420
Victor, that storm is deadly.
We need to abort.

161
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:38,173
Get a grip, Reed. We didn't come all this
way to lose our nerve at the first glitch.

162
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,341
Just close the shields.

163
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,885
-Ben is still out there.
-So reel him in.

164
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:45,597
But we came here to do a job,
so let's do it quickly.

165
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,935
Victor, Reed's right.
We have less than six minutes!

166
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,566
-Ben, you need to get inside now.
-What's going on?

167
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,026
<i>l ain't done</i>
<i>arranging your flowers yet, egghead.</i>

168
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,611
<i>Ben, turn around!</i>

169
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,664
<i>Guys, I'm not gonna make it.</i>

170
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,875
Ben, you gotta jump. lt's the only way!

171
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,007
-What are you doing?
-Closing the shields.

172
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,593
-You can't just leave them out there.
-Watch me.

173
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,473
-You can't help them any more than l can.
-l can try.

174
00:13:43,114 --> 00:13:44,406
Come on, Ben, you got it!

175
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,245
Okay, Johnny,
get ready to close the portal.

176
00:14:44,342 --> 00:14:46,343
Wake up. Ben.

177
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,347
Rise and shine, big boy. How you feeling?

178
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:52,307
Where am l?

179
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:55,769
Back on Earth. We're in quarantine.
Victor's medical facility.

180
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,437
Reed? Sue?

181
00:14:57,522 --> 00:15:00,190
They're fine. Everybody else is fine.

182
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,485
What's wrong with me?

183
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,990
l swear to you, Ben. They've done
everything humanly possible.

184
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,075
The best plastic surgeons
in the world are here, Ben.

185
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,201
You had the best.

186
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,538
-Give me that mirror.
-l don't know if that's a good idea.

187
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:17,874
-They said the shock alone...
-l said give me that goddamn mirror!

188
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,003
Okay, Ben, just be strong.

189
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:29,303
Unfortunately, the doctors
just couldn't do anything to fix your face.

190
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,184
-Hi.
-Hey.

191
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,271
Nice do. I'm liking the grandpa look.

192
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:41,148
What?

193
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:02,544
-How's she doing?
-Stable and her vitals are strong.

194
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,547
Blood panels show no irradiation. Good.

195
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,635
-You'll step up this protocol every...
-Every four hours, yes.

196
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:11,386
We know what we're doing.

197
00:16:11,471 --> 00:16:14,014
Another day of observation
and you're all clear.

198
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:17,601
Excuse me.
More flowers from Mr. Von Doom.

199
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,064
She's allergic to orchids.

200
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,150
Put the sunflowers by her bed,
they're her favorites.

201
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,878
Well, Victor,

202
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,381
the bank would like to congratulate you

203
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,008
on the fastest freefall
since the Depression.

204
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,677
We can't even give your stock away.

205
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,345
Ned, you know l can turn this around.

206
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:56,431
Well, you're going to have to, Victor,
or we pull out.

207
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,310
You have a week.

208
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,646
You're enjoying this, aren't you, Ned?

209
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,110
One week.

210
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,541
Where do we think we're going?

211
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,875
l don't know if we've noticed

212
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,962
but the sickest runs this side of the Alps
are right outside that window.

213
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:29,589
Yeah, I've noticed,
but there are rules here.

214
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,008
-You can't leave until we...
-Until we've finish the tests.

215
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:36,471
l know, I've never been good with rules.
You let me know how those come out.

216
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,809
-Do you wanna help me with this zipper?
-You know, this is not a ski resort.

217
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,770
Not yet. Luckily, Grandma still sends
care packages, though.

218
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:47,232
You know, it's amazing, for an 80-year-old
woman, you'd be surprised...

219
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:50,485
-You are trouble.
-Trouble is my middle name.

220
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,695
You're hot!

221
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:53,989
Why, thank you. So are you.
And I'm not afraid to cry.

222
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,574
No, l mean, you feel a little feverish.

223
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,535
Well, I've never felt better in my life.
My God, you smell good.

224
00:17:58,661 --> 00:18:00,662
Listen, when do you get off work?

225
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,497
-4:00, but l...
-Tell you what.

226
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,542
You meet me at 4:01
at the top of the mountain.

227
00:18:06,294 --> 00:18:09,838
That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
This is yours, that's mine.

228
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:11,840
Nurses!

229
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,222
How long was l out?

230
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,435
Three days. Man, l was worried about you.

231
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,854
-How are you feeling?
-Solid.

232
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,858
-That was a close one, though, huh?
-Yeah.

233
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,360
-What was that about?
-l don't know.

234
00:18:33,696 --> 00:18:35,363
l really don't know.

235
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:39,201
I've been going over the figures
again and again and they all add up.

236
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,204
l just don't understand.
Maybe l should have aborted...

237
00:18:42,288 --> 00:18:46,082
Reed, it was a freak of nature.
You couldn't have possibly predicted it.

238
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:47,375
Let it go.

239
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,214
You know, you live through
something like this,

240
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:55,217
it really makes you appreciate
having the right woman in your life.

241
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,887
-Yeah, you and Debbie are perfect.
-I'm not talking about Debbie.

242
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,225
What? Come on.

243
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,519
She's got a good thing with Victor.

244
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:07,646
He's smart, he's powerful,
he's successful...

245
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,648
Well, maybe you should date him then.

246
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,567
Ben, she ended up with the right guy.

247
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:15,237
Things worked out for the best.

248
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,700
Do l have to do everything myself?

249
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,515
All right.
l think you should stay to the right.

250
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:45,433
The left might give you trouble.

251
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,228
-l think we should drop, like, 1 0 more feet.
-Good.

252
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,647
Last one down springs for room service!

253
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,240
That's my future wife.

254
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,059
You're losing!

255
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,104
All right, no more kid's stuff.

256
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,440
Check this out.

257
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,324
You're on fire.

258
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,034
Thanks! You're pretty good, too.

259
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,912
No, you're on fire. Look!

260
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,281
Care to join me?

261
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,833
l can only stay for one drink
'cause l have to meet Victor.

262
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,294
Well, wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

263
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:39,214
Reed, what are you doing here?

264
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:40,632
l thought...

265
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,261
Great! Maybe you can join us.

266
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:47,555
How's the lPO now?

267
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,683
lt's falling. We're looking at low 20s.

268
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,851
lt's a good number
considering the fallout from...

269
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,395
From Reed's disaster?

270
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:57,315
Get me on the a.m. shows,
<i>Larry King, the cover of the Journal.</i>

271
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,069
l have to do something about this scar.

272
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,906
Make sure they only shoot me
from my left side.

273
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:08,243
Actually, the scar's tracking well.

274
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:10,662
People seem to think it humanizes you.

275
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:13,915
And that's a good thing?

276
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:19,713
You know,
maybe you should get some rest.

277
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:20,880
Later.

278
00:22:21,257 --> 00:22:23,717
First, l have some unfinished business.

279
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,094
A deal that needs closing.

280
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:29,180
Sir, l have always wondered, why Sue?

281
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,933
You could have any other woman
in the world.

282
00:22:32,018 --> 00:22:35,186
That's why.
Because l could have any other woman.

283
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,274
-No, let me tell the story.
-No, let him tell the story.

284
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,326
-You all right?
-Yeah, bad shrimp.

285
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:53,413
l think l better go lie down.

286
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,248
Excuse me.

287
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,959
Oh, God!

288
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,977
<i>So, you feeling better?</i>

289
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,563
Yes, thank you.

290
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,148
Good.

291
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,152
That's...good.

292
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,657
You always had a way with words.

293
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:37,165
Wow. l should be going because

294
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,668
l have to meet Victor.

295
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,962
I'm really happy for you and Victor.

296
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,007
You're really happy for me and Victor?

297
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:49,677
l can tell you guys are enjoying
what was the best part of our relationship.

298
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,554
-Which was?
-Passion

299
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,682
for science.

300
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,019
You're such a dork, Reed.

301
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,146
You never got it,

302
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,857
-and you never will...
-Well, what did l say?

303
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,943
...unless it's explained to you
in quantum physics.

304
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:06,319
l just wanted to let you know that l...

305
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,947
lt's been two years
and all you can say is that you're happy

306
00:24:09,031 --> 00:24:11,032
for me and some other guy?

307
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:12,951
Victor may be a lot of things.

308
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:16,162
But at least he's not afraid
to fight for what he wants.

309
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,748
lt's nice to be wanted sometimes, Reed.

310
00:24:20,543 --> 00:24:23,378
To be seen and heard.

311
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,007
Look at me.

312
00:24:30,594 --> 00:24:31,678
l can't.

313
00:24:31,762 --> 00:24:33,680
What do you mean, you can't?
Look at me!

314
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,557
Sue, look at your hands!

315
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,703
Hey, you guys.

316
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,415
You are never gonna believe
what just happened to me.

317
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:01,666
What?

318
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:05,128
Well, l can explain this.

319
00:25:32,573 --> 00:25:35,950
lt has to be the cloud.
lt's fundamentally altered our DNA.

320
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,619
Let's not jump to conclusions.

321
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,622
We need a massive amount of evidence
before making that leap.

322
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:42,290
Guys, look!

323
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,970
Now, picture that, but everywhere.

324
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,307
lt was everywhere.

325
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:01,351
What?

326
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,813
The cloud has fundamentally altered
our DNA.

327
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,942
-Cool!
-We need to find Ben.

328
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:11,110
And you know what, guys?
l think l was flying.

329
00:26:18,202 --> 00:26:19,702
l said, cut it out, Johnny.

330
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,246
-I'm getting the hang of it.
-Johnny.

331
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,498
-Ben, it's Reed.
-Stop.

332
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,041
-All right.
-All right?

333
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,459
-Yes.
-God!

334
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:27,877
-God?
-What's wrong with you?

335
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,087
-What?
-Sue, do you know the code?

336
00:26:29,171 --> 00:26:30,171
l might.

337
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:39,681
Ben, open up.

338
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:40,807
You all right, Ben?

339
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,976
Does somebody have keys to these doors?

340
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,186
Anybody?

341
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,523
Just break the glass. lt can't be that thick.

342
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,484
Give me another couple of seconds, guys.
l almost got it.

343
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,318
That's gross.

344
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,325
Ben?

345
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,577
Look, look, look, look, look.

346
00:27:46,123 --> 00:27:47,290
What is that thing?

347
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:50,877
What's going on?

348
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:53,046
What happened in here?

349
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,714
Victor, are you feeling all right?

350
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,466
I'm fine. Just a few scrapes, that's all.

351
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,842
Ben did this.

352
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,095
He's had some kind of reaction
to exposure from the cloud.

353
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,057
We all have different symptoms.

354
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:05,308
Symptoms?

355
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:08,353
-Victor, l should have...
-Just find him.

356
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,900
Anybody got any ideas
where the big guy's going?

357
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,238
He's going home.

358
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,321
You gotta be kidding me.

359
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,663
Little buttons.

360
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,706
Hello, Operator?

361
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,878
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Debs?

362
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:18,172
-lt's me.
<i>-Ben?</i>

363
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:21,676
<i>Are you all right?</i>
<i>You sound a little different.</i>

364
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:24,679
-Listen, l need you to come out front.
<i>-Out front?</i>

365
00:29:25,347 --> 00:29:26,848
<i>You're home, baby?</i>

366
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,724
Yeah.

367
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,187
<i>I got a surprise for you.</i>

368
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:38,025
Yeah, l got a little one for you, too.

369
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:42,989
Ben?

370
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,869
Where are you?

371
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,704
I'm over here.

372
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,874
Don't come any closer for a sec, okay?

373
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:57,044
lt's gonna be a bit of a shock.

374
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,046
Honey, what's going on?

375
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:00,548
Debs,

376
00:30:01,717 --> 00:30:04,051
remember when we used to say,

377
00:30:04,386 --> 00:30:07,263
"Together forever no matter what?"

378
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,223
Yeah.

379
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,976
Well...

380
00:30:12,394 --> 00:30:14,228
Baby, you're scaring me.

381
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,410
Oh, my God.

382
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,872
Deb, it's me. lt's still me.

383
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,749
lt was the accident. Let me explain.

384
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:37,043
-No! Don't touch me!
-Debs!

385
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,593
Hey, I'm calling the police.

386
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,720
Everybody all right?

387
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,306
l saw him. lt's that guy over there!

388
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,899
<i>Okay, so he was there last night.</i>

389
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:02,652
Debbie's gonna meet us
on the other side of the bridge.

390
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,459
Yeah, Ben.

391
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,128
"A few days in space. It'll be great.

392
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:24,257
"What's the worst that could happen?"

393
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,637
Hey, little guy.

394
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,808
You're not afraid of me, are you?

395
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:40,606
Perfect.

396
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,317
Thanks.

397
00:31:57,666 --> 00:31:58,833
Hey!

398
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,504
You think you've got problems?
You take a good look, pal.

399
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:06,549
How bad could it be, right?

400
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,843
l don't think you...

401
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:14,140
Okay, pal. Take it easy.
No, don't go out there.

402
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:16,809
Look, l said stop, you fruitcake!

403
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,686
No. Come close.

404
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:21,772
That's further. Come closer.

405
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,150
l said, stop! No!

406
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,009
Come here.

407
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:16,160
All right, calm down.

408
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:19,330
You wanna be scared?

409
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,248
-Fine!
-No!

410
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,386
Get back, everybody! Get back!

411
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:36,347
Get back in your vehicle.
We'll tell you when you can go.

412
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,642
-What do we do now?
-We're not going to get past these guys.

413
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:41,102
But you could.

414
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:48,317
Sorry about the truck, pal. Come on.

415
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:51,779
A little help, here?
You wanna hit the button, sir?

416
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,322
lt's stuck.

417
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,118
Sue, your clothes. Lose them.

418
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:58,994
Right.

419
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:01,414
This is so wrong.

420
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:12,341
-Wow, you've been working out.
-Shut up!

421
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:15,428
All right.

422
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,267
All right, freeze!

423
00:34:21,643 --> 00:34:23,018
Now just...

424
00:34:23,645 --> 00:34:26,188
Just put the man in the seat down.

425
00:34:27,441 --> 00:34:28,649
Do it!

426
00:34:33,822 --> 00:34:35,197
Any more great ideas?

427
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,783
Why don't you strip down
and have a 1 00 people stare at you?

428
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:39,660
-Sue.
-What?

429
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,875
I'm gonna need therapy.

430
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,004
Come on, let's get out of here.

431
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,883
Excuse me. Coming through.

432
00:34:58,472 --> 00:35:01,724
All right, now just back away from him.

433
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:06,645
And l want you to put your hands
on your head...

434
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,322
954 approaching scene.

435
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,407
l still can't believe you made me do that.

436
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,910
We got through, didn't we? Just find Ben.

437
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,044
Ben! Ben!

438
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:39,929
Mom! Mom!

439
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,268
Stay here, okay?

440
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,686
I'm coming.

441
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,271
Hold on.

442
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:14,523
Hang on!

443
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:21,989
l got you.

444
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:03,906
<i>Get down on the ground.</i>

445
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:06,909
<i>Get down on the ground now!</i>

446
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:13,499
Ben.

447
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:28,866
l swear to you

448
00:39:29,576 --> 00:39:32,036
l will do everything in my power

449
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,496
until there is not a breath left in me.

450
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,125
You're going to be Ben again.

451
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:50,054
l told you l felt fine.

452
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,806
Where are your ears?

453
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:59,188
There are some folks outside
that want to talk to you.

454
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,981
We're not going public with this.

455
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:02,858
We're scientists, not celebrities.

456
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,401
lt's too late, son.

457
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:05,861
Look.

458
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:08,822
<i>...when a New York Fire Department</i>
<i>ladder truck...</i>

459
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:09,948
See that?

460
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,200
<i>...became part of the tragedy.</i>

461
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:13,660
<i>But the rescue itself is not the story.</i>

462
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:16,246
<i>One of the four stretched</i>
<i>to an amazing length...</i>

463
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:19,666
That's what they're calling you.
"The Fantastic Four."

464
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,044
-Cool.
-No, wait! Where are you going?

465
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,253
I'm gonna go talk to them.

466
00:40:23,338 --> 00:40:25,380
No, we should think this through.

467
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:27,424
That's great. Brainstorm.

468
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,806
Get back here, right now. Johnny!

469
00:40:36,476 --> 00:40:37,893
Settle down.

470
00:40:40,313 --> 00:40:42,022
Do you believe this?

471
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,483
Which one of you is the leader?

472
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,193
That would be me.

473
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:47,820
No, seriously.

474
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:51,782
Okay, son. You're on.

475
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,669
During our recent mission
to the Von Doom space station,

476
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,423
we were exposed to
as yet unidentified radioactive energy.

477
00:41:08,508 --> 00:41:10,175
-What happened on the bridge?
-How can you stretch?

478
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,094
-Were you really on fire?
-ls it true you can fly?

479
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:14,179
Yeah, I'm working on it.
lt's actually really difficult.

480
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:16,765
No, actually, we do not know
much more than you do at this point.

481
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,811
Sir, Larry King just canceled.

482
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,605
Apparently, there's a bigger story.

483
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:30,279
<i>Actually, here they come now.</i>
<i>You had to see it to believe it, folks.</i>

484
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:32,906
<i>-The man...</i>
<i>-...named The Fantastic Four...</i>

485
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,951
<i>We'll be going directly to our lab</i>
<i>to diagnose our symptoms.</i>

486
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,786
<i>Symptoms? ls this some kind of disease?</i>

487
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,414
No. lt's not a disease.

488
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,334
If having special powers is a disease,
then, yeah, we got it bad.

489
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,962
Excuse me,
that thing doesn't look so fantastic.

490
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:49,298
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero.

491
00:41:49,424 --> 00:41:51,842
What he means is,
every team needs a mascot.

492
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:57,264
A new day is dawning.
The day of the Fantastic Four.

493
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,935
Look!

494
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:05,606
<i>We went up to space</i>
<i>to find a way to understand DNA,</i>

495
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,025
<i>cure disease, save lives.</i>

496
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:12,696
<i>Well, now it's our DNA, our disease,</i>
<i>our lives on the line.</i>

497
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:16,283
<i>Thank you. No more questions.</i>

498
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,828
This is how you turn things around?

499
00:42:20,163 --> 00:42:23,707
These freaks on the front page?
Your companies in the obituaries?

500
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,834
l was planning to use the publicity.

501
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,129
The board's in agreement,
the bank's lost enough already.

502
00:42:29,714 --> 00:42:31,840
-Wait a minute.
-lt's too late, Victor.

503
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,886
Do you know how much money
I've invested in this company?

504
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,221
Victor, stop.

505
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,807
This isn't a negotiation. lt's a notification.

506
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:43,644
We're pulling out.

507
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:28,188
ls all that for you, Dr. Richards?

508
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,564
I'm afraid so.

509
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:36,029
Come on, Ben, smile.
They want to like you, Ben. Say hi.

510
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,952
Don't do drugs.

511
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,425
Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards.

512
00:43:56,551 --> 00:43:58,635
l have got the usual for you.

513
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,429
Good to have you back, sir.

514
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,763
Thanks, Willie.

515
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,934
We had a tough year.

516
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,228
Yeah, like nine straight.

517
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,578
Either we're moving really fast
or not at all.

518
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:34,588
I'll take the stairs.

519
00:44:43,806 --> 00:44:46,224
How come Ben can't turn it on and off
like we can?

520
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,143
That's what we're here to find out.

521
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,312
l mean, if it happened to him...

522
00:44:50,438 --> 00:44:53,774
What? You mean, like, we won't be able
to turn it off, either?

523
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:55,233
That would save time.

524
00:44:55,318 --> 00:44:58,320
You don't really wanna walk around on fire
for the rest of your life, do you?

525
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,072
-ls that a trick question?
-Grow up.

526
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,116
Come on.
Am l the only guy who thinks this is cool?

527
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:07,579
We should stay here until we can define
the extent of our changes

528
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,123
and figure out how to reverse them.

529
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,798
But l have to warn you, it's gonna be
a little crowded in some areas.

530
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:26,056
So, what do you think?

531
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:31,353
l don't know, Reed, l think you might be
bringing your work home with you.

532
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,856
Come on. Let me show you guys
where you'll be staying.

533
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,234
Busy guy.

534
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:47,369
Mr. Von Doom, would you like to comment
on the recent failure of your lPO?

535
00:45:47,495 --> 00:45:49,371
What about the rumors of a takeover?

536
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,395
God, l was so worried about you.

537
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,690
Victor. I'm sorry
l didn't get a chance to call.

538
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:18,525
Please.

539
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,402
No apologies.

540
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:24,573
I've arranged for your things to be moved
to one of my condos.

541
00:46:24,699 --> 00:46:26,324
You'll have round-the-clock care.

542
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,660
Thank you. That's very generous of you.

543
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,538
But l think l should stay here
with my brother

544
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,040
until we get a handle on things.

545
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,294
Susan, l think you should let my doctors
have a look at you.

546
00:46:37,378 --> 00:46:40,213
Victor, what are you doing here?

547
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:44,384
I'm starting to wonder the same thing.

548
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:48,263
How much do you know
about what happened to you?

549
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,431
Not much.

550
00:46:49,557 --> 00:46:51,725
We need to run tests
to see the extent of the damage.

551
00:46:51,851 --> 00:46:55,520
Well, you let me know what l can do.
We're all in this together now.

552
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,364
Victor, wait.

553
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:11,578
l just wanted to say I'm sorry
the mission didn't go as planned.

554
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,789
Didn't go as planned?
lt was a catastrophe.

555
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:17,209
You ruined the lives of four people.

556
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:20,086
With all due respect, we're both to blame.
l told you to abort.

557
00:47:20,213 --> 00:47:21,296
Abort?

558
00:47:21,422 --> 00:47:24,591
l put my company, my name,
billions of dollars on the line.

559
00:47:24,717 --> 00:47:27,302
l will not let you make me look like a fool.

560
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:28,762
Victor, if we can understand...

561
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:32,098
l don't wanna understand it!
This isn't one of your science projects!

562
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:34,601
l just wanna fix it. Fast!

563
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,646
ls there a problem?

564
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,319
No.

565
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:46,947
No problem, Ben.

566
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:51,326
Just pay your damn electric bill
and get to work on finding a cure.

567
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:28,321
He's heating up from his core.

568
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:30,407
And his vitals are completely normal.

569
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,660
If we're going to identify
the source of the mutation,

570
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:35,829
we need to isolate
your recombinant DNAs

571
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,248
so we can activate positional genomes.

572
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,251
We have to do a physical
in order to see what got zapped.

573
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,336
Why didn't you just say so?

574
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,506
His internal organs are completely solid.

575
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,094
How bad is it?

576
00:48:51,512 --> 00:48:53,263
You know, l used to smoke.

577
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,350
lt's not invisibility per se.

578
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:01,187
You should be able to bend light
around other objects, even people,

579
00:49:01,314 --> 00:49:04,107
if you could control
your emotional state better.

580
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,358
Excuse me?

581
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:08,945
I'm saying, if you had a little more
self-control, you could locate the trigger.

582
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:12,282
Can you remember your exact emotions
on the bridge?

583
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:13,533
Anger.

584
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,535
Rage.

585
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,370
Frustration.

586
00:49:17,455 --> 00:49:19,873
Okay. ls there any way
to duplicate that feeling?

587
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,708
Some memory or...

588
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:25,128
I'm sure l can come up with something.

589
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:27,672
-You feel anything?
-Nope.

590
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,883
Okay.

591
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,974
lt's hotter than l anticipated.

592
00:49:38,059 --> 00:49:40,727
-Okay, Johnny, back it down.
-l can go hotter!

593
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:42,729
<i>Johnny, just back it down.</i>

594
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,866
-Johnny, back it down right now!
-Johnny!

595
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,501
Buzz kill!
You guys are cramping my style.

596
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,920
Johnny, you were at 4,000 Kelvin.

597
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,255
Any hotter
and you're approaching supernova.

598
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,341
-Sweet!
-No, not sweet!

599
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:13,259
That's the temperature of the sun.

600
00:50:13,344 --> 00:50:15,095
Not only could you kill yourself

601
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,846
but you could set fire
to Earth's atmosphere

602
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,015
and destroy all human life as we know it.

603
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,227
Got it. Supernova: bad.

604
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:30,944
How's that coming?

605
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:40,453
-I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
-Yeah, fine.

606
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,122
-You sure?
-Yeah.

607
00:50:42,248 --> 00:50:43,456
l...

608
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:48,044
You probably thought
that was some form of latent hostility.

609
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:50,630
What in the world
would give me that idea?

610
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:58,263
l mean, you broke up with me, right?

611
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,223
-Are you kidding?
-No.

612
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:03,309
l distinctly remember,
you walked out my door, ergo...

613
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:06,479
l was ready for the next step, you weren't.
Ergo, l walked.

614
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,648
l think it was little bit more
complicated than that.

615
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:12,652
l just wanted to share an apartment.
What was so complicated about that?

616
00:51:13,112 --> 00:51:15,989
-There were a lot of variables to consider.
-No, there weren't.

617
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:20,076
There was you and me.
There were no variables, no math.

618
00:51:20,161 --> 00:51:22,412
lt was actually
the simplest thing in the world.

619
00:51:22,496 --> 00:51:24,330
But like always, Reed,
your head got in the way.

620
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:26,499
-No, it didn't.
-Then what was it?

621
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:32,130
Did you feel anything when l left?

622
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:36,426
Do you feel anything right now?

623
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,180
Hey, guys.

624
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,809
l think we have a serious problem.

625
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:00,200
So what's the prognosis?

626
00:52:00,493 --> 00:52:04,871
Your tissue, your organs, your entire
biophysical structure is changing.

627
00:52:04,997 --> 00:52:07,499
Every system is still functioning somehow.

628
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,542
And it's changing into?

629
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,211
l don't really know.

630
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:14,380
Some kind of organic-metallic alloy,

631
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:18,218
stronger than titanium or carbon steel,
harder than diamonds.

632
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,179
Like the shields
Reed said would protect us.

633
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:27,894
How long?

634
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,731
At this rate, the infection could be
complete in two, maybe three weeks.

635
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,316
What do you mean complete?

636
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,984
l wish l could tell you.

637
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:38,029
l can't pretend to know
what we're dealing with here.

638
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,241
I'll have to notify the CDC.

639
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:43,243
-What?
-Center for Disease Control.

640
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,327
l know what it is.

641
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,831
If this thing is contagious, we may have
a big problem on our hands.

642
00:52:47,915 --> 00:52:50,208
We're talking about an epidemic here.

643
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,085
Look at me.

644
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,421
l have a life.

645
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:58,591
I'm the face of a billion-dollar company.

646
00:53:00,094 --> 00:53:02,762
We need to keep this confidential.

647
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:07,225
Victor, this disease is progressive,
degenerative. l have to notify someone...

648
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:09,435
That's terrible news.

649
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,445
But l think I'll get a second opinion.

650
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,686
Our uniforms were exposed
to the storm, like us.

651
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,688
So they can transform like us.

652
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:57,650
Becoming invisible, changing size on
demand or remaining impervious to flame.

653
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,944
You guys look like an '80s rock band.

654
00:54:00,029 --> 00:54:02,280
You know, Ben, this material stretches.

655
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,824
I'm sure l can figure out a way
to make it fit.

656
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:06,910
l wouldn't be caught dead wearing that.

657
00:54:06,994 --> 00:54:10,246
l love these costumes. They're missing
something, though. Needs, like, spice.

658
00:54:10,331 --> 00:54:11,497
They're not costumes.

659
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:13,917
You can't use your powers in public,
Johnny.

660
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:17,253
-You guys are worse than NASA.
-You could burn somebody.

661
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,505
Maybe it's missing a utility belt.

662
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,346
Here you go, there's your change.

663
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,682
Can l help you, buddy?

664
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:33,144
-Oh, my.
-lt's Sue Storm, it's the invisible Woman!

665
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:36,356
Sue Storm, it is you.
Listen, my kid loves you!

666
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:47,241
l can't believe I'm doing this again.

667
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,628
Reed, we really can't go outside anymore.

668
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:00,964
We are on the cover of
every publication from...

669
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:04,884
All right, I'm here, let's make this quick.
l got a lot of places to go today.

670
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,762
Oh, wait. l don't go anywhere.

671
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:11,432
Johnny, it's imperative that we stay inside
for the foreseeable future.

672
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:14,852
l know, l know, but when you said that
last time, my brain heard "a week."

673
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:17,146
Johnny, it's too dangerous
for you to be in public.

674
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,523
You've been saying that for years.

675
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:20,858
What worries me is
that our powers are evolving.

676
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,735
l know! l know!

677
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:25,863
l am so close to flying, guys, l can taste it.

678
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:27,865
-You can't fly.
-Yet.

679
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:30,118
Johnny, can you put that napkin out?

680
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:31,411
Jesus.

681
00:55:32,705 --> 00:55:35,748
So what's going on, Reed?
How're you going to cure us?

682
00:55:35,916 --> 00:55:38,751
I'm going to build a machine
to recreate the storm.

683
00:55:39,211 --> 00:55:42,797
The cosmic rays will travel
from this generator to this chamber.

684
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,257
What, no pop-ups?

685
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:48,594
-If l can reverse the wave signal...
-It'll return us back to normal.

686
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:53,975
Right. But what are the risks?

687
00:55:54,101 --> 00:55:57,979
Even a small miscalculation could increase
our symptoms exponentially

688
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,605
or perhaps even kill us.

689
00:55:59,732 --> 00:56:02,442
Now, dying. That's bad, right?

690
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:05,069
l say we just let sleeping dogs lie, guys.

691
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,572
So how long
till this contraption's up and running?

692
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:09,574
-l don't know, it's hard to say.
-How long, Reed?

693
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,492
-l don't know.
-You don't know?

694
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,746
-Ben, you don't want this to get worse.
-Worse than that?

695
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:19,375
Guys, look, we're gonna be stuck here
for a while, so let's just try and get along.

696
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,460
Okay?

697
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,810
-You could knock!
-Sorry!

698
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:14,514
Johnny!

Hello?

707
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,719
Victor?

708
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,891
What's with these lights, huh?

709
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,269
About the lPO, no hard feelings, right?

710
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,605
Nothing personal.

711
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:54,113
You know, you could always move back
to Latveria.

712
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:56,115
Start fresh.

713
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,744
Maybe that's where you belong,
the old country.

714
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,636
Nothing personal, Ned.

715
00:59:18,138 --> 00:59:19,847

Hey, pretty boy, let's see what you got.

723
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,198
Where's your hot sister and the monster?

01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:23,536
Let's go!

01:01:09,583 --> 01:01:11,459
<i>Show us something new.</i>

732
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:14,754
<i>Something new.</i>

733
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:16,922
<i>You got it.</i>

734
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:27,558

01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:31,645
Wait, no!

737
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:44,116
That's dangerous.

738
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:50,122
I'm okay, I'm all right, I'm good.

739
01:01:50,624 --> 01:01:52,458
<i>He's okay! He's all right!</i>

740
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:55,294
<i>Johnny Storm, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

741
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,924
<i>I have to give you props, Johnny!</i>
<i>You were on fire!</i>

742
01:02:10,644 --> 01:02:12,978
-He didn't.
-Oh, yes, he did.

743
01:02:13,438 --> 01:02:16,816
-Flame Boy never listens.
-What did he do to his uniform?

744
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:21,070
<i>Johnny, I've gotta ask you</i>
<i>about this outfit.</i>

745
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,239
Yeah, it's sort of
Armani meets astronaut.

746
01:02:23,323 --> 01:02:25,116
So what are your superhero names?

747
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,619
They call me the Human Torch.
Ladies call me Torch.

748
01:02:29,121 --> 01:02:30,830
What about the rest of the team?

749
01:02:30,956 --> 01:02:32,832
<i>-That's the invisible Girl.</i>
-Girl?

750
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:36,293
<i>What about your leader, Reed Richards?</i>
<i>I hear you call him Mr. Fantastic.</i>

751
01:02:36,378 --> 01:02:37,878
-Could've been worse.
-l guess.

752
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:42,174
<i>Is it true what they say about him that</i>
<i>he can expand any part of his anatomy?</i>

753
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:46,470
<i>Well, I've always found him</i>
<i>to be a little limp.</i>

754
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:50,474
What is that?
What do you call that thing?

755
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,560
<i>That's it. The Thing.</i>

756
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,062
<i>Yeah, you think this is bad,</i>
<i>you should have seen him before.</i>

757
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:57,356
Okay. Now I'm gonna go kill him.

758
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,657
There he is.

759
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:15,875
-Johnny!
-Can we talk about this later, guys?

760
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:18,210
-No. We can't talk about this later.
-We can do this at home.

761
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,628
-What are you thinking?
-Where's my ride?

762
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:21,046
We're totally exposed.

763
01:03:32,767 --> 01:03:34,101
You think that's funny, Pebbles?

764
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,227
-Johnny!
-What?

765
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,563
You gave us names? You don't think.

766
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:39,857
So, now you're the face
of the Fantastic Four?

767
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:41,901
A face that's about to be broken!

768
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:43,527
Look, this isn't permanent, Johnny.

769
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:45,571
We need to be careful
until we're normal again.

770
01:03:45,697 --> 01:03:49,033
What if l don't wanna be normal?
l didn't turn into a monster!

771
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:50,117
Ben!

772
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:01,587
Did you just...

773
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,422
Johnny, stop it.

774
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,466
-That's it, Tinkerbell!
-No, Ben.

775
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,885
You wanna fly? Then fly!

776
01:04:13,892 --> 01:04:17,102
Wait a minute, guys! Ben, don't do this!

777
01:04:17,729 --> 01:04:19,772
Let's see if we can get blood
from a stone.

778
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,774
Let's see. Bring it, burnout!

779
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,609
You two need a time-out!

780
01:04:26,446 --> 01:04:28,030
Talk to blockhead, he started it.

781
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,407
l don't care. Damn it, Johnny.

782
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:33,452
Ben, wait!

783
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:35,621
What?

784
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,627
You need to control yourself
and think before you act.

785
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:45,047
Yeah, but see, that's your problem.
You always think, you never act.

786
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,551
What if we got these powers for a reason?
What if it's like some higher calling?

787
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:50,970
A higher calling?
Like getting girls and making money?

788
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,596
ls there any higher?

789
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:55,140
You know what, Reed?
This is who we are.

790
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:56,767
Accept it.

791
01:04:57,978 --> 01:05:00,271
Or better yet, enjoy it.

792
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:08,612
Wait, Ben, slow down. He didn't mean it.

793
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,490
You know Johnny.
He's always been a hothead.

794
01:05:11,575 --> 01:05:13,993
lt ain't him. lt's them!

795
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:17,162
l can't live like this.

796
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:19,832
Just give Reed a little more time.
You know how he works.

797
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:22,334
Analyzing every little step
before he takes one.

798
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:25,129
-lt's easy for you to be patient.
-No, it's not!

799
01:05:26,006 --> 01:05:28,841
l thought l was done waiting for Reed,
but l...

800
01:05:32,012 --> 01:05:34,513
-We're all in this together, Ben.
-Together?

801
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:39,184
Susie, look at me.
You got no idea what I'd...

802
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:44,023
What I'd give to be invisible.

803
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,373
Thank you, gentlemen.

804
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:05,044
I'm just gonna pick up a few things

805
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,838
for some friends.

806
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:26,690
Perfect.

807
01:06:55,595 --> 01:06:57,054
That's not funny.

808
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,682
This is Ben Grimm here.

809
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:02,601
The first mook from Brooklyn
to go into outer space.

810
01:07:02,727 --> 01:07:04,436
So pay him some respect.

811
01:07:04,562 --> 01:07:06,605
Just give me the usual and I'm out.

812
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:07,773
All right.

813
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,068
-Make it a double.
-Make it a triple.

814
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:16,365
-Put it on my tab, Ernie.
-All right, Alicia.

815
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,741
Appreciate it.

816
01:07:18,243 --> 01:07:19,368
No problem.

817
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:26,125
lt's okay, Ben.

818
01:07:26,209 --> 01:07:28,627
If there's a God, he hates me.

819
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:31,255
She is not so into hate.

820
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,718
If you could see me,
you wouldn't be saying that.

821
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,302
Then let me see you.

822
01:07:38,471 --> 01:07:39,638
Can l?

823
01:07:44,936 --> 01:07:46,645
-Be careful.
-lt's okay.

824
01:08:09,294 --> 01:08:10,627
So sad.

825
01:08:14,466 --> 01:08:18,510
You know,
being different isn't always a bad thing.

826
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:23,640
Trust me. This ain't one of them times.

827
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,853
Not if you don't want it to be.

828
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:32,024
-All right, Ernie, I'm out of here.
-I'll take you.

829
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:33,650
See you later, Benny.

830
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,534
I'm Alicia, by the way.

831
01:08:47,707 --> 01:08:49,041
Thanks, Ernie.

832
01:08:58,551 --> 01:09:01,011
Reed got what he wanted.

833
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,388
And everything he wanted

834
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,891
he took from me.

835
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,566
Now it's time to take it back.

836
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:21,740
But first,
l need to get rid of his bodyguard.

837
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:38,423
This seat taken?

838
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,343
What are you doing here?

839
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,388
l was worried about you.

840
01:09:44,848 --> 01:09:47,432
You were worried about me?
That's sweet.

841
01:09:48,101 --> 01:09:50,435
Come on.
Let me buy you something to eat.

842
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:55,023
Looks like you could use the company.

843
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,113
Reed?

844
01:10:08,288 --> 01:10:10,789
-l was just resting my eyes.
-So l see.

845
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,710
The new readouts look very promising.

846
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,461
Not promising enough.

847
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,297
When are the next tests?

848
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,133
I've run out of plans.

849
01:10:22,886 --> 01:10:24,720
So l was thinking maybe...

850
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:29,057
There's always me.

851
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,643
No. lt's too soon.

852
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:34,563
-Reed?
-l should get back to work.

853
01:10:34,814 --> 01:10:37,316
-You need a break.
-Sue, not now, please.

854
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,109
Come on. Let's go.

855
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:47,034
Remember our first date here?
God, l was nervous.

856
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:51,330
You know, l bribed the projectionist
10 bucks to keep the place open late.

857
01:10:51,414 --> 01:10:54,291
Really? l gave him 20.

858
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:55,918
-No.
-Yeah.

859
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:57,461
-No way.
-Yeah.

860
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:02,257
l didn't want that night to end.

861
01:11:02,342 --> 01:11:03,342
Sue.

862
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:08,347
You were right, it wasn't complicated.

863
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:11,141
l just wasn't ready to...

864
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:15,103
You always talked about how you liked
the kind of man who could approach you,

865
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:16,521
speak his mind.

866
01:11:16,606 --> 01:11:19,024
One who wasn't afraid to tell you
exactly what he wanted.

867
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,192
l did.

868
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,612
But l wanted you to be that man.

869
01:11:24,030 --> 01:11:25,781
Well, why didn't you say something?

870
01:11:25,865 --> 01:11:29,326
Reed, I'm saying it now.

871
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:41,463
Excuse me.

872
01:11:46,052 --> 01:11:47,594
l know it's not easy.

873
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:51,181
Life hasn't changed that much for Reed,
Sue, or Johnny.

874
01:11:51,265 --> 01:11:54,059
At least they can still go out in public.
But for you...

875
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:56,895
If you're trying to cheer me up,
you're doing a hell of a job.

876
01:11:56,980 --> 01:11:58,397
You know what l mean, Scarface?

877
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:01,316
I'm just saying l know what it's like
to lose something that you love,

878
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,402
to see it slip away
and know it's never coming back.

879
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:04,653
Look.

880
01:12:05,363 --> 01:12:07,614
Reed is gonna fix me up, okay?

881
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:11,576
For your sake l hope you're right.

882
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:13,620
Look, he's a brilliant man.

883
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:16,832
We should all trust
that he's working as hard as he can.

884
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,583
You're his best friend.

885
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:21,878
So what possible reason could he have
for taking his time?

886
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,801
l mean, other than spending
more time with Sue.

887
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,391
-Wow, l had no idea.
-lt's true.

888
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:39,771
Yeah.

889
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:42,274
l have that effect on people.

890
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:44,985
Ben.

891
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,239
So you remember my name now, do you?

892
01:12:50,366 --> 01:12:53,744
Do you also remember
what you swore to do

893
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,704
with every breath in your body?

894
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:57,789
We're working as hard as we can.

895
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:00,333
Yeah. l can tell.

896
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:04,212
-Victor was right.
-Victor?

897
01:13:05,048 --> 01:13:08,300
Ben, l don't know if this thing
will change us back or make us worse.

898
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,218
l need you to be patient
for a little while longer.

899
01:13:10,303 --> 01:13:11,386
Reed, look at me!

900
01:13:11,471 --> 01:13:14,139
l am looking.
That's why l can't make a mistake.

901
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,892
I've gotta get it right and it's not right yet!
We need to test...

902
01:13:16,976 --> 01:13:20,062
l spent my whole life protecting you,
and for what?

903
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:22,272
So you can play Twister
with your girlfriend

904
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:24,357
while I'm the freak of the week?

905
01:13:25,610 --> 01:13:26,818
Ben, stop it!

906
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:30,113
-You stay out of this, Susie!
-Stop it, or l will.

907
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,200
Get off me, rubber boy!

908
01:13:33,868 --> 01:13:35,494
You guys, quit it.

909
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,330
Ben!

910
01:13:52,095 --> 01:13:53,887
Calm down!

911
01:14:08,402 --> 01:14:11,571
Good thing you're flexible enough
to watch your own back.

912
01:14:19,539 --> 01:14:21,623
'Cause l ain't doing it no more.

913
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:26,878
You two are on your own.

914
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:40,392
Look what the marketing guys gave me.

915
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,686
Look, check it out, listen.
You're gonna love this.

916
01:14:42,770 --> 01:14:45,188
<i>It's clobbering time!</i>

917
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,857
lt's catchy, right?

918
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:50,193
Isn't that great?

919
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:54,906
That was the prototype.

920
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:00,662
Ben!

921
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:05,083
-Johnny, have you seen Ben?
-Yeah, Sunshine just left.

922
01:15:05,168 --> 01:15:07,878
Look, Sue, I'm sorry.
l can't stand this freak show.

923
01:15:07,962 --> 01:15:11,256
-l gotta get back to the real world.
-You're calling that the real world?

924
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,384
Sue, stop. You're not Mom.
Don't talk to me like I'm a little boy, okay?

925
01:15:14,468 --> 01:15:16,803
Maybe l would
if you stopped acting like one.

926
01:15:16,888 --> 01:15:19,806
Do you even hear yourself?
Who do you think you are?

927
01:15:19,891 --> 01:15:22,767
Why is everyone on my ass?
If you guys are jealous, that's fine.

928
01:15:22,852 --> 01:15:24,436
l didn't expect it
to come from you, though.

929
01:15:24,520 --> 01:15:27,230
You really think those people out there
care about you?

930
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:28,940
You're just a fad to them, Johnny!

931
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:32,277
Let's try something new.
You live your life, I'll live mine.

932
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,488
Sound good?

933
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:40,493
And just for the record, they love me!

934
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:27,374
Oh, God. Reed.

935
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:10,875
Oh, my God, Reed. What did you do?

936
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:13,211
-l can make it work.
-No!

937
01:17:13,296 --> 01:17:17,048
l need more power to control the storm.

938
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,300
More power?

939
01:17:18,384 --> 01:17:20,885
<i>-You need a doctor. Come with me.</i>
<i>-Sue.</i>

940
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:23,638
<i>-One more try...</i>
<i>-You need to rest.</i>

941
01:17:23,723 --> 01:17:27,183
Leonard, bring me our lab rat.

942
01:17:31,731 --> 01:17:33,815
Ben. Come in.

943
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:37,569
What is this? Where's Reed?

944
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,155
Where do you think? With Sue.

945
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:43,325
I'll take it from here, Leonard.

946
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:45,577
Yes, sir.

947
01:17:50,666 --> 01:17:52,250
What do you want, Vic?

948
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:53,585
To help you.

949
01:17:54,754 --> 01:17:57,422
The machine is ready.

950
01:17:57,882 --> 01:17:59,257
But Reed said it wouldn't...

951
01:17:59,342 --> 01:18:01,676
He also said we'd avoid
that storm in space

952
01:18:01,761 --> 01:18:03,928
but we all know how that turned out.

953
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:08,266
He couldn't generate enough power
for the machine to reach critical mass.

954
01:18:08,559 --> 01:18:11,770
Yet another mistake for Mr. Fantastic.

955
01:18:12,438 --> 01:18:14,564
-And you can?
-Yes.

956
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:19,778
Tell me,

957
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,865
do you want to be Ben Grimm again?

958
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:10,221
Thank you.

959
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:25,236
Vic?

960
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,074
Vic, it worked.

961
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:36,414
Vic?

962
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:40,418
Everyone thought l was safe
behind those shields.

963
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,589
Oh, my God.

964
01:20:45,925 --> 01:20:48,593
The machine worked for me.
lt can work for you, too!

965
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:51,804
lt did, Ben. lt worked perfectly.

966
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:57,018
-You planned this.
-I've always wanted power.

967
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:01,606
Now l have an unlimited supply.

968
01:21:01,982 --> 01:21:03,900
And no Thing to stand in your way.

969
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:05,610
Take a good look, Ben.

970
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:09,614
This is what a man looks like
who embraces his destiny.

971
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,454
One down, three to go.

972
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:18,790
Vic?

973
01:21:20,042 --> 01:21:21,334
Right on cue.

974
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:23,294
Ben?

975
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:26,881
-What did you do?
-Exactly what l said l would.

976
01:21:26,966 --> 01:21:30,176
l built a better, stronger being.

977
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:33,721
And outsmarted the great Reed Richards.

978
01:21:33,806 --> 01:21:37,141
If you've exposed yourself to the storm,
you're endangering your life.

979
01:21:37,476 --> 01:21:40,228
-You need help.
-You always know best.

980
01:21:42,147 --> 01:21:45,191
So tell me, what happens
when you superheat rubber?

981
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:10,008
No!

982
01:22:19,852 --> 01:22:22,520
Mr. Von Doom, are you okay?

983
01:22:23,439 --> 01:22:24,689
Never better, Jimmy.

984
01:22:37,036 --> 01:22:40,204
Why the long face? Let's talk in my office.

985
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:01,726
Ben.

986
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:05,605
Sue!

987
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:07,649
Johnny, the machine worked!

988
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,068
Give me a hand. Come on.

989
01:23:10,235 --> 01:23:11,235
Ben.

990
01:23:12,571 --> 01:23:13,821
Get his arm.

991
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:18,451
You all right, Ben? Put him on the step.

992
01:23:18,577 --> 01:23:21,746
What happened, big guy?
l leave you for five minutes...

993
01:23:22,748 --> 01:23:23,915
The machine.

994
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:28,211
Vic used it on himself.
He was affected by the cloud like us.

995
01:23:28,295 --> 01:23:30,963
-Where's Reed?
-Vic must have taken him.

996
01:23:35,803 --> 01:23:38,930
Dr. Richards,
allow me to begin your lesson.

997
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:41,265
Chemistry 1 01 .

998
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:46,270
What happens to rubber
when it's supercooled?

999
01:23:51,151 --> 01:23:52,485
Give up?

1000
01:23:55,114 --> 01:23:56,823
That's not like you, Reed.

1001
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,290
After all, we're both doctors.

1002
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:09,836
Painful?

1003
01:24:10,629 --> 01:24:12,380
You don't know the meaning of the word.

1004
01:24:20,848 --> 01:24:23,725
Just a little something
from our defense contracts.

1005
01:24:28,355 --> 01:24:31,858
Let's check in on the rest of the family,
shall we?

1006
01:24:38,365 --> 01:24:40,074
We've got to get out of here.

1007
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:41,409
Oh, no.

1008
01:24:43,245 --> 01:24:45,913
Wait a minute. l got an idea!

1009
01:24:45,998 --> 01:24:48,416
-Don't even think about it.
-Never do.

1010
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,043
What are you doing? Johnny, no!

1011
01:24:57,092 --> 01:25:00,344
Come on, come on, come on, flame on!

1012
01:25:13,192 --> 01:25:14,817
We have to help Reed.

1013
01:25:14,902 --> 01:25:17,987
lt's too dangerous for you now.
You have to stay here.

1014
01:25:20,199 --> 01:25:21,699
What did l do?

1015
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:00,238
Come on, think!

1016
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:25,263
Two down, two to go.

1017
01:26:38,944 --> 01:26:40,152
Sue.

1018
01:26:42,447 --> 01:26:45,241
-What has he done to you?
-How romantic.

1019
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,120
Victor, please.

1020
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:51,956
Call me Doom.

1021
01:26:53,000 --> 01:26:56,878
The machine works. lt worked on Ben,
it can work on you. We can turn you back.

1022
01:26:56,962 --> 01:27:01,090
Do you really think fate turned us
into gods so we could refuse these gifts?

1023
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:04,093
Victor, you always thought
you were a god. Now back off.

1024
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:06,262
Susan, let's not fight.

1025
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:07,638
No. Let's.

1026
01:27:12,769 --> 01:27:14,979
Susan, you're fired!

1027
01:27:25,699 --> 01:27:27,158
Marco.

1028
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,660
Polo.

1029
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:45,801
Did you say goodbye
to your brother Johnny?

1030
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:52,308
lt's time to end this!

1031
01:27:54,519 --> 01:27:57,355
No, Vic. lt's clobbering time.

1032
01:28:06,365 --> 01:28:08,532
Damn, I've been waiting to do that.

1033
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:10,993
Susie, you okay?

1034
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:14,038
Victor ain't that bad, huh?

1035
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:18,960
"He's just a little larger than life," right?

1036
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:22,129
Maybe next time
you'll listen to me before...

1037
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:23,839
Ben!

1038
01:29:14,558 --> 01:29:16,517
-Sorry, ladies.
-Stop the car!

1039
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,937
Pull over. Hit the brakes!

1040
01:29:28,572 --> 01:29:30,072
<i>This is the police.</i>

1041
01:29:30,574 --> 01:29:34,368
<i>Put your hands up</i>
<i>and step down from the vehicle!</i>

1042
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:39,081
Take him out!

1043
01:29:45,255 --> 01:29:47,798
Ladies, I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

1044
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:50,926
-The transmission sticks.
-Not gonna be a problem.

1045
01:30:28,632 --> 01:30:30,633
l can't let you do that!

1046
01:30:32,010 --> 01:30:33,177
Reed?

1047
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:37,181
I'll be right with you.

1048
01:30:44,314 --> 01:30:45,648
Hello, Susan.

1049
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:49,610
You three are pathetic.

1050
01:30:58,078 --> 01:30:59,328
You missed me.

1051
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,166
Had a little relapse, huh?

1052
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,170
-Welcome back.
-This is gonna be fun.

1053
01:31:30,527 --> 01:31:32,194
l can't hold it!

1054
01:31:44,541 --> 01:31:46,083
Johnny, supernova!

1055
01:31:46,168 --> 01:31:47,668
l thought we agreed that was bad.

1056
01:31:47,752 --> 01:31:48,794
Now!

1057
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:52,089
-Ben!
-Gotcha.

1058
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,892
Sue! Think you can contain it?

1059
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:15,446
Flame on, kid.

1060
01:32:39,638 --> 01:32:43,057
ls that the best you can do?

1061
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:45,434
Time for your lesson. Chem 1 01 .

1062
01:32:45,769 --> 01:32:48,312
What happens
when you rapidly cool hot metal?

1063
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:50,981
Ben!

1064
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,573
You done good, kid.

1065
01:33:43,201 --> 01:33:44,368
Come on.

1066
01:33:46,329 --> 01:33:47,663
Sue, you okay?

1067
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:49,164
Yeah.

1068
01:33:57,215 --> 01:33:58,716
Man, l love this job.

1069
01:34:00,343 --> 01:34:01,552
Job, huh?

1070
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:04,555
Well, we do have the suits.

1071
01:34:26,453 --> 01:34:27,703
Ladies, your drinks.

1072
01:34:27,787 --> 01:34:30,164
-l don't think we need another.
-Just one more.

1073
01:34:30,248 --> 01:34:32,916
Thank you, thank you so much. Cheers!

1074
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:38,589
l need names and shots.

1075
01:34:38,882 --> 01:34:40,049
Bartender!

1076
01:34:40,467 --> 01:34:43,010
They're custom-made, 36 EEEE.

1077
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:45,971
Well, look. I've been crunching
the numbers on the machine.

1078
01:34:46,097 --> 01:34:47,848
And l think if l can rework
the power settings...

1079
01:34:47,932 --> 01:34:50,601
Forget about it, egghead. I'm good as is.

1080
01:34:50,727 --> 01:34:52,728
Better than good, baby.

1081
01:34:54,147 --> 01:34:56,607
You just need to work on your touch.

1082
01:34:57,776 --> 01:34:59,443
l like the sound of that.

1083
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:04,990
-Can l talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

1084
01:35:09,621 --> 01:35:10,621
Thanks.

1085
01:35:16,294 --> 01:35:18,879
l found a broken gasket from space.

1086
01:35:20,298 --> 01:35:21,340
A gasket?

1087
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:25,511
-Reed, come on, we're at a party.
-And if one of us were to wear it...

1088
01:35:34,813 --> 01:35:36,146
No more thinking.

1089
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:38,190
No more variables.

1090
01:35:41,319 --> 01:35:42,486
Sue Storm,

1091
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:44,822
will you marry me?

1092
01:35:56,042 --> 01:36:00,003
Sue, you kind of need to say something.

1093
01:36:00,839 --> 01:36:02,297
Yes.

1094
01:36:12,183 --> 01:36:15,561
That's my nose, genius. These are my lips.

1095
01:36:21,568 --> 01:36:23,026
She's kissing him.

1096
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,862
That's so cute.

1097
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:27,948
About time, you guys.

1098
01:36:29,367 --> 01:36:31,785
No more wisecracks about the way l look.

1099
01:36:33,913 --> 01:36:35,622
Call me Mr. Sensitivity.

1100
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,752
Okay. Wide load coming through.
Everybody move, he's huge.

1101
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:44,298
-Come here, Mr. Sensitive.
-Flame on.

1102
01:36:48,094 --> 01:36:49,219
Showoff!

1103
01:37:13,077 --> 01:37:14,578
How long will it be?

1104
01:37:14,913 --> 01:37:16,622
Should be about 12 days.

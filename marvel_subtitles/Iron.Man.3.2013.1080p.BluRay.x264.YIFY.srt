They lied to me.

It's embarrassing.

A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1734
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,562

the vice president as well.

Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1747
01:30:36,240 --> 01:30:38,720
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1748
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:39,927
But we also have to figure out this

1749

- vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1750
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:43,080
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1751

RHODEY: <i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1763
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:09,120
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

1765
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:12,401
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1766
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:14,608
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1767
01:31:14,680 --> 01:31:17,604
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:19,520
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.

RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1775
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,610
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

(MECHANICAL CLANKING)

2050
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,204
Jarvis,

2051
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,770
do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

2052
01:51:31,200 --> 01:51:32,281
No...

2053
01:51:40,040 --> 01:51:41,485
(SCREAMING)

2054
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:43,440
(GRUNTING)

(GROANING)

2060
01:52:46,200 --> 01:52:48,328
No more false faces.

2061
01:52:49,160 --> 01:52:50,969
You said you wanted the Mandarin.

2062
01:52:52,160 --> 01:52:54,845
You're looking right at him.

2063
01:52:55,200 --> 01:52:58,204
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

2064
01:52:58,680 --> 01:53:00,364
I am the Mandarin!

2065
01:53:03,600 --> 01:53:05,648
(BREATHING HARD)

2066
01:53:11,800 --> 01:53:13,040
I got nothing.

2067
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:17,170
(GRUNTING)

2068
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,645
Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock
is not a target, disengage!

2069
01:53:24,440 --> 01:53:25,601
(REPULSOR POWERING UP)

2070
01:53:29,360 --> 01:53:30,361
(GROWLS)

2071
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:32,803
What?
Oh, what, are you mad at me?

2072
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:35,571
(GRUNTING)

2073
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:43,371
(BOTH GRUNTING)

2074
01:53:44,080 --> 01:53:45,081
Whoo!

2075
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:58,811
(PANTING)

2076
01:53:58,920 --> 01:54:00,126
TONY: Honey?

2077
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:06,044
Oh, my God.

2078
01:54:07,600 --> 01:54:09,807
That was really violent.

2079
01:54:10,800 --> 01:54:12,802
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

2080
01:54:12,960 --> 01:54:15,008
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

2081
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,164
Who's the hot mess now?

2082
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,402
It's still debatable.

2083
01:54:22,960 --> 01:54:24,246
Probably tipping your way a little bit.

2084
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,368
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?

2085
01:54:26,440 --> 01:54:28,363
Sport bra. The whole deal.

2086
01:54:28,440 --> 01:54:31,649
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

2087
01:54:31,840 --> 01:54:34,366
What am I going to complain
about now?

2088
01:54:35,200 --> 01:54:36,850
Well, it's me.

2089
01:54:37,640 --> 01:54:38,687
You'll think of something.

2090
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:41,651
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

2091
01:54:41,720 --> 01:54:43,643
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.

2092
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:45,681
Not hot.

2093
01:54:47,080 --> 01:54:48,764
Am I gonna be okay?

2094
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:49,841
No.

2095
01:54:49,920 --> 01:54:52,651
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

2096
01:54:52,920 --> 01:54:54,763
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

2097
01:54:55,000 --> 01:54:56,729
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

2098
01:54:56,800 --> 01:54:59,929
I think I can get you better.

2099
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:03,086
That's what I do. I fix stuff.

2100
01:55:03,160 --> 01:55:05,447
And all your distractions?

2101
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:08,082
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

2102
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:10,687
Jarvis. Hey.

2103
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,082
JARVIS: <i>All wrapped up here, sir.
Will there be anything else?</i>

2104
01:55:14,320 --> 01:55:16,288
You know what to do.

2105
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:19,125
<i>The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?</i>

2106
01:55:19,200 --> 01:55:22,363
Screw it, it's Christmas.
Yes, yes.

2107
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:56,165
(KISSES)

2108
01:55:58,680 --> 01:55:59,966
Okay, so far?
Do you like it?

2109
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:01,087
(SIGHS)

2110
01:56:02,520 --> 01:56:03,567
It'll do.

2111
01:56:12,640 --> 01:56:15,325
TONY: <i>And so,
as Christmas morning began,</i>

2112
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:18,085
<i>my journey had reached its end.</i>

2113
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:23,522
<i>You start with something pure,</i>

2114
01:56:24,520 --> 01:56:28,764
<i>something exciting.
Then, come the mistakes.</i>

2115
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:31,570
<i>The compromises.</i>

2116
01:56:38,120 --> 01:56:40,851
<i>- We create our own demons.</i>
(REPORTERS CALLING)

- Oh!
(ALL CLAMOURING)

2118
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,242
Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!

2119
01:56:49,800 --> 01:56:53,521
TONY: <i>As promised, I got Pepper
sorted out. It took some tinkering.</i>

2120
01:56:53,600 --> 01:56:57,400
<i>But then I thought to myself,
"Why stop there?"</i>

2121
01:57:01,240 --> 01:57:04,562
<i>Of course, there are people who
say progress is dangerous,</i>

2122
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:08,167
<i>but I'll bet none of those idiots ever
had to live with a chestful of shrapnel.</i>

2123
01:57:08,560 --> 01:57:11,609
<i>And now, neither will I.</i>

2124
01:57:12,400 --> 01:57:14,289
<i>- Let me tell you...</i>
(METAL CLINKING)

2125
01:57:14,360 --> 01:57:16,522
<i>...that was the best sleep
I'd had in years.</i>

It's okay. It's okay.

2129
01:57:39,480 --> 01:57:40,527
It's okay.

2130
01:57:40,600 --> 01:57:41,601

tie it with a bow, or whatever...</i>

2134
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,324
<i>I guess I'd say my armour,
it was never a distraction,</i>

2135
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:09,482
<i>or a hobby.</i>

2136
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:11,562
<i>It was a cocoon.</i>

2137
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:14,569
<i>And now,</i>

2138
01:59:15,520 --> 01:59:17,807

by the way. For listening.</i>

2145
02:09:06,840 --> 02:09:09,286

my chest,</i>

2146

<i>and putting it out there in the
atmosphere, instead of holding this in...</i>

you know.</i>

2148

<i>Wow, I had no idea
you were such a good listener.</i>

2149
02:09:18,920 --> 02:09:21,446
To be able to share
all my intimate thoughts

2150
02:09:21,520 --> 02:09:22,646
and my experiences with someone,

2151
02:09:22,720 --> 02:09:25,246
it just cuts the weight of it in half.

2152
02:09:25,360 --> 02:09:26,725
You know, it's like a snake
swallowing its own tail.

2153

Everything comes full circle.

- And the fact that you've been able to

- help me process...
(CLEARS THROAT)

- Are you with me?
- Sorry... I was, yeah.

We were at, uh...

2158
02:09:37,440 --> 02:09:38,646
Are you actively napping?

02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:52,730
I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor.

2164
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:54,651
I'm not a therapist.

2165
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,689
- It's not my training.
- So?

2166
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,404
- I don't have the...
- What? The time?

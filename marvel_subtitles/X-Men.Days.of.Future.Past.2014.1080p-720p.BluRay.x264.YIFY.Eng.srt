1
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,220
The future

2
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:19,222
a dark, desolate world.

3
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:27,418
A world of war.

4
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:29,756
Suffering.

5
00:01:30,326 --> 00:01:33,116
Loss on both sides.

6
00:01:35,032 --> 00:01:38,596
Mutants and the humans who
dared to help them.

7
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:46,163
Fighting an enemy
we cannot defeat.

8
00:02:13,803 --> 00:02:16,091
Are we destined on this path?

9
00:02:16,115 --> 00:02:21,271
Destined to destroy ourselves
like so many species before us?

10
00:02:25,956 --> 00:02:29,853
Or can we evolve fast enough
to change ourselves?

11
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:32,298
Change our fate?

12
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:41,166
Is the future truly set?

13
00:04:10,894 --> 00:04:11,894
They're here.

14
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:19,201
Time's up. Sentinels.

15
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,083
Sunspot.

16
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,061
Let's go.

17
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,081
Run.

18
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:01,530
Blink

19
00:07:01,786 --> 00:07:02,786
No.

20
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:50,849
Too late assholes...

21
00:08:25,501 --> 00:08:26,634
So few of us left.

22
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:32,752
Professor.

23
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:34,786
I found them.

24
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,524
Professor.

25
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:11,359
Bobby.

26
00:10:12,677 --> 00:10:13,677
Hey kid.

27
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:17,501
Professor, you made it.

28
00:10:29,561 --> 00:10:32,054
Whenever the sentinels attack
warpath spots them...

29
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:36,534
and I send bishop back to warn us
of the attack before it happens.

30
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:38,752
Blink scouts the next site and...

31
00:10:40,044 --> 00:10:42,298
well, then we leave before
they ever know we were there.

32
00:10:42,402 --> 00:10:44,567
Because we never were.

33
00:10:45,085 --> 00:10:47,047
What do you mean
you were never there?

34
00:10:47,048 --> 00:10:51,441
She projects bishop back in time a few days
to warn the others of the coming attack.

35
00:10:52,412 --> 00:10:54,225
Then she sends
bishop back in time.

36
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:58,597
No, just his consciousness into
his younger self his younger body.

37
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,630
This might just work Charles.

38
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:06,745
What might work?

39
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:11,536
The sentinel program was originally
conceived by doctor Bolivar Trask.

40
00:11:12,282 --> 00:11:16,417
In the early 70's he was one of the
world's leading weapons designers.

41
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:20,976
But covert he had begun
experimenting on mutants...

42
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:24,582
using their gifts to
fuel his own research.

43
00:11:26,106 --> 00:11:29,107
There was one mutant who had
discovered what he was doing.

44
00:11:29,696 --> 00:11:34,242
A mutant with the ability to
transform herself into anyone.

45
00:11:35,359 --> 00:11:36,359
Mystique.

46
00:11:37,442 --> 00:11:38,709
I knew her as Raven.

47
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:42,086
We met when we were children,
grew up together.

48
00:11:44,048 --> 00:11:45,849
She was like a sister to me.

49
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,158
I tried to help her but only
succeeded in driving her away.

50
00:11:52,104 --> 00:11:54,633
She hunted Trask
across the world...

51
00:11:55,543 --> 00:12:01,973
and at the Paris peace accords in 1973
after the Vietnam war she found Trask

52
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:06,348
and killed him.

53
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:14,852
It was the first time she killed.

54
00:12:14,853 --> 00:12:16,053
It wasn't her last.

55
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:20,189
But killing Trask did not
have the outcome she expected.

56
00:12:20,238 --> 00:12:24,419
It only persuaded the government
to believe in his program.

57
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:26,780
They captured her that day.

58
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,411
Tortured her.

59
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:29,881
Experimented on her.

60
00:12:30,776 --> 00:12:35,113
In her DNA they discovered the secrets
to her powers of transformation.

61
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:38,777
It gave them the key
they needed to create...

62
00:12:38,789 --> 00:12:41,631
weapons that could adapt
to any mutant power...

63
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:45,705
and the result is the
machines that have

64
00:12:45,717 --> 00:12:49,058
destroyed so many of our
kind were created...

65
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:53,774
and it all started
that day in 1973.

66
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:59,258
The day she first killed the
day she truly became Mystique.

67
00:13:01,777 --> 00:13:03,377
You wanna go back there?

68
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:06,072
If I can get to her,
stop the assassination,

69
00:13:06,084 --> 00:13:08,605
keep her out of their hands...

70
00:13:08,606 --> 00:13:12,075
then we can stop the
sentinels from ever being born

71
00:13:12,213 --> 00:13:14,746
and end this war
before it ever begins.

72
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:22,265
I can send someone
back a couple of weeks...

73
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:26,976
maybe a month but you're
talking about going back decades.

74
00:13:27,209 --> 00:13:30,603
You have the most powerful
brain in the world... Professor

75
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:33,958
but the mind can only stretch
so far before it snaps

76
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:37,448
it would rip you apart I'm sorry

77
00:13:38,907 --> 00:13:40,907
no one could survive that trip.

78
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:43,569
What if someone's mind
has a way of snapping back?

79
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:48,549
What if someone could heal
as fast as they rip apart?

80
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,200
Ok spread out.

81
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,280
Get in position.

82
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:34,784
So I wake up in my younger
body, God knows where, then what?

83
00:14:35,705 --> 00:14:38,239
You'll need to go to
my house and find me.

84
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,598
Convince me of all of this.

85
00:14:41,311 --> 00:14:43,204
Won't you just be
able to read my mind?

86
00:14:43,205 --> 00:14:46,128
I didn't have my powers in 1973.

87
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:50,746
Logan, you're going to have to do for
me what I once did for you.

88
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,013
Lead me, guide me.

89
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:56,423
I was a very
different man then.

90
00:14:56,424 --> 00:14:58,424
You'll have to be patient with me.

91
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:01,518
Patience isn't my strongest suit.

92
00:15:02,265 --> 00:15:03,732
You'll need me as well.

93
00:15:03,739 --> 00:15:04,450
What?

94
00:15:04,451 --> 00:15:10,098
After Mystique left Charles she came
with me and I set her on a dangerous path.

95
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:11,931
A darker path.

96
00:15:12,538 --> 00:15:14,781
It's going to take the
two of us side by side.

97
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:17,047
At a time when we
couldn't be further apart.

98
00:15:21,328 --> 00:15:22,329
Great.

99
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:24,654
So where do I find you?

100
00:15:25,011 --> 00:15:26,078
Well, it's complicated.

101
00:15:30,147 --> 00:15:33,336
Basically your body will go to sleep,
while your mind travels back in time.

102
00:15:34,113 --> 00:15:37,716
As long as you're back there past
and present will continue to coexist.

103
00:15:38,576 --> 00:15:39,910
But once you wake up...

104
00:15:41,636 --> 00:15:43,893
whatever you've done will
take hold and become history.

105
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:47,201
And for the rest of us it'll be
the only history that we know.

106
00:15:47,248 --> 00:15:50,003
It'll be like the last
50 years never happened.

107
00:15:51,286 --> 00:15:53,042
In this world, this war.

108
00:15:54,098 --> 00:15:57,007
The only person who
will remember it is you.

109
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:03,396
Alright Logan I need you to clear your
head and to stay as calm as possible.

110
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:04,708
What, what do you mean?

111
00:16:04,709 --> 00:16:07,360
If your mind gets rocky it'll
be harder for me to hold you.

112
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:09,783
You could start to slip
between past and future.

113
00:16:09,784 --> 00:16:11,314
What if I need to
get a little rocky.

114
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:14,331
Think peaceful thoughts.

115
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,841
Peaceful thoughts.

116
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:17,679
Do you have any good news?

117
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,903
Well, you don't really age so
you'll pretty much look the same.

118
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,891
You won't have much
time in the past.

119
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:25,832
Sentinels will find us.

120
00:16:26,294 --> 00:16:27,294
They always do.

121
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:30,621
And this time we won't be able
to run, we'll have no escape.

122
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:33,796
This is our last chance.

123
00:16:35,054 --> 00:16:36,814
Do you really think
this will work?

124
00:16:36,815 --> 00:16:38,268
I have faith in him.

125
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,278
It's not him I'm worried
about, it us, we were young.

126
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:43,947
We didn't know any better.

127
00:16:44,921 --> 00:16:45,921
We will now.

128
00:16:48,722 --> 00:16:49,722
As we always do.

129
00:16:49,891 --> 00:16:51,559
This might sting a little.

130
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,179
Holy shit.

131
00:18:37,211 --> 00:18:38,211
What?

132
00:18:43,746 --> 00:18:45,014
Hey! What's going on?

133
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,270
Get dressed.

134
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,212
Hey... I don't know what's going on.

135
00:18:48,213 --> 00:18:49,609
What's going on is that
you're supposed to be...

136
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:51,423
guarding the boss' daughter,
not screwing her.

137
00:18:51,606 --> 00:18:53,365
I didn't sleep with her.

138
00:18:53,544 --> 00:18:54,545
- No?
- No.

139
00:18:55,075 --> 00:18:58,455
I mean yes, I slept
with her many times but...

140
00:18:58,456 --> 00:18:59,224
Jimmy!

141
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:04,956
That wasn't me, that was the old me,
I just got here like 20 seconds ago.

142
00:19:04,957 --> 00:19:05,985
Really, yeah.

143
00:19:05,986 --> 00:19:07,547
Well then what happened
to your clothes?

144
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:12,285
Would you believe me if I told you
I was sent here from the future?

145
00:19:12,579 --> 00:19:13,579
What?

146
00:19:15,078 --> 00:19:16,400
Get out of here sweetheart, yeah!

147
00:19:16,896 --> 00:19:17,941
We're gonna take
care of this comedian.

148
00:19:17,942 --> 00:19:18,588
No you're not.

149
00:19:18,714 --> 00:19:20,532
You're gonna give me the
keys to your car and some...

150
00:19:20,544 --> 00:19:22,373
money for gas or you're gonna
wake up in the hospital.

151
00:19:22,374 --> 00:19:24,270
Trust me, I know how
these things play out.

152
00:19:24,271 --> 00:19:25,707
Oh,
because you're from the future.

153
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:28,373
No, because of these.

154
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,590
What the hell!

155
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,229
Goddammit!

156
00:19:59,013 --> 00:20:00,214
Peaceful thoughts.

157
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:19,132
We are reviewing all of
our defense expenditures...

158
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:21,261
and all the black
books are being opened.

159
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:25,429
We can't support a weapon
that targets our own citizens.

160
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:28,580
If these mutants as you
described are already living...

161
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:31,677
among us then they are
living here peacefully.

162
00:20:31,678 --> 00:20:33,903
We haven't had an
incident in over 10 years.

163
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:36,174
After what happened in Cuba,
it was never confirmed.

164
00:20:36,745 --> 00:20:40,351
We have real enemies out there,
the Russians, the Chinese.

165
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:45,300
We are talking about a tenth of a
tenth of a tenth of our population.

166
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:48,199
Allow me to read
something to you.

167
00:20:48,239 --> 00:20:49,239
Please.

168
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:51,850
This was acquired by
our friends at the CIA.

169
00:20:52,783 --> 00:20:59,219
It's a dissertation written by a
mutant at Oxford university and I quote...

170
00:20:59,863 --> 00:21:04,669
to Homo-Neanderthals,
his mutant cousin Homosapiens

171
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:05,671
which is us.

172
00:21:06,147 --> 00:21:11,747
Was an aberration, the arrival of the
mutated human species, Homosapiens...

173
00:21:12,302 --> 00:21:16,399
was followed by the immediate
extinction of their less evolved kind.

174
00:21:17,504 --> 00:21:22,418
Well, now we are the Neanderthal.

175
00:21:22,419 --> 00:21:24,854
Speak for yourself Dr. Trask.

176
00:21:26,877 --> 00:21:29,317
You know, when you sent
those soldiers to Vietnam...

177
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,782
without the weapons, they
needed to win the war.

178
00:21:31,783 --> 00:21:34,215
You underestimated your enemy.

179
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:37,872
You do that with this
enemy, it won't be some...

180
00:21:37,884 --> 00:21:41,464
border skirmish halfway
around the world.

181
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,796
This time the war will be for our
streets, our cities, our homes

182
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:50,159
and by the time you see the
need for my program, it'll be...

183
00:21:50,171 --> 00:21:54,171
too late and you will have
lost two wars in one lifetime.

184
00:22:00,844 --> 00:22:02,244
We're sorry Dr. Trask.

185
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:07,462
But your sentinel program,
it ain't gonna fly.

186
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,110
Can I help you Colonel?

187
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:24,318
Just here to give our
boys a proper send off.

188
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:27,407
Sorry Sir! But we have orders.
This is a Quarantined Area.

189
00:22:28,009 --> 00:22:30,985
Stand aside Soldier!
That's an order.

190
00:22:41,573 --> 00:22:42,573
Attention!

191
00:22:43,255 --> 00:22:44,255
At ease.

192
00:23:07,737 --> 00:23:08,805
What is all this?

193
00:23:09,258 --> 00:23:10,258
Lab reports, blood tests.

194
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:12,684
Some getting packed
up and shipped back.

195
00:23:12,901 --> 00:23:13,910
Where is it going?

196
00:23:13,911 --> 00:23:15,178
Same place they are.

197
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:16,921
Trask Industries.

198
00:23:18,726 --> 00:23:20,396
Let's go gentlemen.

199
00:23:20,397 --> 00:23:22,248
Taking you outta this shit show.

200
00:23:23,051 --> 00:23:24,052
Shipping home?

201
00:23:25,765 --> 00:23:26,765
Not just yet.

202
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,102
What are you doing with those?

203
00:23:29,103 --> 00:23:30,784
It's gonna make the
ride a little smoother.

204
00:23:31,074 --> 00:23:33,790
We're transferring you to a
private facility where we can...

205
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:35,326
run a few more tests.

206
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:42,786
Your men are not military.

207
00:23:43,542 --> 00:23:44,542
Private outfit.

208
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:47,634
We're authorized
to remand these men.

209
00:23:51,551 --> 00:23:53,509
These troops are going home.

210
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:56,829
Well, colonel, I don't think you
have jurisdiction in this matter.

211
00:23:58,771 --> 00:23:59,772
I'm afraid I do son.

212
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:02,551
I'm sorry who are you?

213
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:04,774
The question is major...

214
00:24:08,543 --> 00:24:09,544
who are you?

215
00:24:55,147 --> 00:24:56,147
Raven.

216
00:24:56,611 --> 00:24:57,811
That's not my name.

217
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:05,800
I had him.

218
00:25:06,166 --> 00:25:07,166
I know.

219
00:25:08,866 --> 00:25:11,000
Let's move out, come on let's go.

220
00:25:11,507 --> 00:25:13,641
Where's Eric? I'm on my own now.

221
00:25:16,561 --> 00:25:17,628
Let's go move it.

222
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:37,854
Hold that plane.

223
00:25:38,408 --> 00:25:40,781
Wouldn't wanna leave these boys
in this godforsaken country.

224
00:25:42,676 --> 00:25:44,876
You're not coming
with us are you?

225
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,389
My war's not over,
the enemy is still out there.

226
00:26:11,573 --> 00:26:12,574
Where'd they go?

227
00:26:12,575 --> 00:26:13,665
The four privates,
where'd they go?

228
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:15,066
They were headed
towards the Tarmac.

229
00:27:14,713 --> 00:27:15,713
Can I help you?

230
00:27:16,294 --> 00:27:18,694
Uh yeah,
what happened to the school?

231
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,828
School's been shut for years.

232
00:27:21,025 --> 00:27:22,093
Are you a parent?

233
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:23,724
Sure as hell hope not.

234
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:24,985
Who are you?

235
00:27:25,065 --> 00:27:27,575
I'm Hank, Hank McCoy,
I look after the house now.

236
00:27:29,295 --> 00:27:30,295
You're Beast?

237
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,260
Look at you, well,
I guess you're a late bloomer.

238
00:27:33,327 --> 00:27:34,847
I don't know what
you're talking about.

239
00:27:35,319 --> 00:27:36,680
I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

240
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,541
So where's the Professor?

241
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:39,866
There's no Professor here.

242
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:41,387
You're pretty strong
for a scrawny kid.

243
00:27:41,858 --> 00:27:44,392
Come on, sure there's
not a Beast in there.

244
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:45,167
Come on! Beast.

245
00:27:45,168 --> 00:27:47,283
There's no one here
Come on! Beastie.

246
00:27:51,244 --> 00:27:52,721
I said this school is closed,
you need to leave.

247
00:27:52,722 --> 00:27:54,151
Not until I see the Professor.

248
00:27:54,152 --> 00:27:56,949
There's no Professor here,
I told you that.

249
00:27:56,950 --> 00:27:57,951
Look kid

250
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:01,448
you and I are gonna
be good friends.

251
00:28:03,195 --> 00:28:04,793
You just don't know it yet.

252
00:28:07,433 --> 00:28:08,433
Professor!

253
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:16,326
Professor!

254
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,266
Hank, what's going on here?

255
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:37,590
Professor!

256
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:39,188
Please don't call me that.

257
00:28:39,189 --> 00:28:40,449
You know this guy.

258
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:44,489
Yeah, he looks slightly familiar,
get off the bloody chandelier. Hank!

259
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:48,285
You can walk.

260
00:28:48,443 --> 00:28:49,977
You're a perceptive one.

261
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,580
I thought Erik...

262
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:54,278
Which was likely that you managed
to miss our sign on the way in,

263
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:57,972
this is a private property my friend,
I'm gonna ask him to ask you to leave.

264
00:28:58,608 --> 00:29:01,275
Well, I'm afraid I
can't do that because...

265
00:29:04,165 --> 00:29:05,917
because I was sent here for you.

266
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:09,452
Well, tell whoever it was
that sent you that I'm busy.

267
00:29:10,008 --> 00:29:14,809
This is gonna be a little tricky
because the person who sent me was you.

268
00:29:14,941 --> 00:29:15,941
What!

269
00:29:15,942 --> 00:29:17,475
About 50 years from now.

270
00:29:17,804 --> 00:29:19,966
50 years from now like in
the future 50 years from now?

271
00:29:20,046 --> 00:29:20,805
Yeah.

272
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:21,887
I sent you from the future.

273
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,228
Piss off!

274
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:28,220
If you had your powers you would
know I was telling the truth.

275
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:30,421
How do you know
I don't have my..

276
00:29:30,917 --> 00:29:31,916
Who are you?

277
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:32,917
I told you.

278
00:29:32,948 --> 00:29:33,765
Are you CIA?

279
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:34,308
No.

280
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:35,190
You were watching me.

281
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:36,513
I know you Charles.

282
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,226
We've been friends for years.

283
00:29:39,635 --> 00:29:41,256
I know your powers
came when you were 9.

284
00:29:42,265 --> 00:29:44,321
I know you thought you
were going crazy when

285
00:29:44,333 --> 00:29:46,401
it started, all the
voices in your head.

286
00:29:46,402 --> 00:29:48,837
And it wasn't until you
were 12 that you realized

287
00:29:48,849 --> 00:29:51,298
that all the voices were
in everyone else's head

288
00:29:52,003 --> 00:29:53,203
do you want me to go on?

289
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,719
I never told anyone that.

290
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,349
Not yet no but, you will.

291
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,159
Alright you've piqued my
interest, what do you want?

292
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,560
We have to stop Raven.

293
00:30:09,442 --> 00:30:10,689
I need your help.

294
00:30:12,261 --> 00:30:13,261
We need your help.

295
00:30:18,631 --> 00:30:19,831
Think I'd like to wake up now.

296
00:30:25,814 --> 00:30:28,015
What does she have
to do with this?

297
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:37,951
So you're saying that they took Raven's
power and what, they weaponized it.

298
00:30:38,206 --> 00:30:39,206
Yup.

299
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:41,032
She is unique.

300
00:30:42,163 --> 00:30:43,163
Yes she is.

301
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,968
In the beginning the sentinels
were just targeting mutants.

302
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:50,238
Then they began to identify
the genetics in non-mutants.

303
00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:54,267
Who'd eventually have mutant
children or grandchildren.

304
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:58,505
Many of the humans tried to
help us, it was a slaughter.

305
00:30:58,506 --> 00:31:01,106
Leaving only the worst
of humanity in charge.

306
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,828
I've been in a lot of wars.

307
00:31:05,392 --> 00:31:07,659
I've never seen
anything like this.

308
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:10,171
And it all starts with her.

309
00:31:10,294 --> 00:31:13,382
Let's just say that for
the sake of, sake that...

310
00:31:13,394 --> 00:31:16,495
I choose to believe you,
that I choose to help you...

311
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:18,900
Raven won't listen to me.

312
00:31:21,411 --> 00:31:24,412
No her heart and soul
belongs to someone else now.

313
00:31:25,893 --> 00:31:26,893
I know.

314
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:31,266
That's why we're
gonna need Magneto too.

315
00:31:31,811 --> 00:31:34,768
Eric, you do know where he is?

316
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,424
Yeah.

317
00:31:42,238 --> 00:31:43,638
He's where he belongs.

318
00:31:44,959 --> 00:31:46,160
So that's it,
you're just gonna walk out.

319
00:31:46,161 --> 00:31:48,750
Oh top marks, like I said,
you are perceptive.

320
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:52,930
The Professor I know would never turn
his back on someone who lost their path

321
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:54,732
especially someone he loved.

322
00:31:57,727 --> 00:32:00,328
You know,
I think I do remember you now.

323
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:04,839
Yeah, we came to you a long
time ago seeking your help.

324
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,434
And I'm gonna say to you
what you said to us then.

325
00:32:10,325 --> 00:32:11,326
Fuck off!

326
00:32:13,121 --> 00:32:14,989
Listen to me you little shit!

327
00:32:15,069 --> 00:32:18,653
I've come a long way, and I watched a
lot of people die, good people, friends.

328
00:32:19,735 --> 00:32:22,596
If you're gonna wallow in
self-pity and do nothing...

329
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:25,479
then you're gonna watch the
same thing, you understand?

330
00:32:30,069 --> 00:32:31,936
We all have to die some time.

331
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:39,484
Told you there was
no Professor here.

332
00:32:40,768 --> 00:32:42,701
What the hell happened to him?

333
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,090
He lost everything.

334
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:52,256
Eric, Raven, his legs.

335
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,362
We built the school,
the labs, this whole place.

336
00:32:56,363 --> 00:33:02,165
Then just after the first semester
the war in Vietnam got worse.

337
00:33:03,228 --> 00:33:06,406
Many of the teachers and all
the students were drafted.

338
00:33:07,797 --> 00:33:09,064
It really broke him.

339
00:33:09,782 --> 00:33:11,449
He retreated into himself.

340
00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:16,501
I wanted to help do something so I
designed a serum to treat his spine.

341
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:21,034
Derived from the same formula
that helps me control my mutation.

342
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:27,633
I take just enough to keep myself
balanced but he takes too much.

343
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:32,191
I tried easing him back but
he just couldn't bear the pain.

344
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:38,467
The voices, the treatment gives him
his legs but it's not enough.

345
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,653
He's just lost too much.

346
00:33:57,947 --> 00:33:59,677
You're not scared of me?

347
00:33:59,702 --> 00:34:03,954
I always believed I couldn't
be the only one in the world.

348
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:06,638
Charles Xavier.

349
00:34:09,033 --> 00:34:10,033
Raven.

350
00:34:10,759 --> 00:34:11,760
You're hungry and alone?

351
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:18,235
Take whatever you want, we've got
lots of food, you don't have to steal.

352
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:22,100
In fact you never
have to steal again

353
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,584
and that's a promise.

354
00:34:30,806 --> 00:34:32,207
I'll help you get her.

355
00:34:34,552 --> 00:34:37,643
But not for any of your
future shots but for her.

356
00:34:37,644 --> 00:34:38,644
Fair enough.

357
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:45,015
Tell you this, you don't know Eric,
that man is a monster, a murderer.

358
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:49,316
You think you can convince
Raven to change, to come home.

359
00:34:50,101 --> 00:34:51,101
Splendid!

360
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:54,984
But what makes you
think you can change him?

361
00:34:54,985 --> 00:34:58,118
Because you and Eric sent
me back here together.

362
00:35:01,410 --> 00:35:03,744
The room they're holding him
in was built during the...

363
00:35:03,756 --> 00:35:06,099
2nd World War when there
was a shortage of steel.

364
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,339
So the foundation is pure
concrete and sand, no metal.

365
00:35:10,082 --> 00:35:13,037
And he's being held a
100 floors beneath the

366
00:35:13,049 --> 00:35:16,017
most heavily guarded
building on the planet.

367
00:35:16,018 --> 00:35:17,219
Why is he in there?

368
00:35:19,226 --> 00:35:20,307
What, he forgot to mention?

369
00:35:22,394 --> 00:35:23,394
Uh JFK.

370
00:35:23,892 --> 00:35:24,893
He killed.

371
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,180
What else would explain the bullet
miraculously curving through the air.

372
00:35:29,626 --> 00:35:31,827
Eric's always had
a way with guns.

373
00:35:31,845 --> 00:35:33,477
You're sure you want
to carry on with this?

374
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:35,375
Well, this is your plan not mine.

375
00:35:35,376 --> 00:35:38,294
We don't have any resources
to get us in, or out.

376
00:35:39,582 --> 00:35:40,982
It's just me and Hank.

377
00:35:41,418 --> 00:35:42,978
I know a guy.

378
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:46,047
Yeah, he'd be a young man now
grew up outside of DC.

379
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:51,089
He could get into anywhere, just don't
know how the hell we're gonna find him.

380
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:54,954
With Cerebro out of the question.

381
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:00,292
We have a phone book.

382
00:36:07,406 --> 00:36:09,826
I thought you'd be getting
ready for your trip Sir.

383
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:11,910
I just came to
grab a couple files.

384
00:36:11,911 --> 00:36:13,911
Is that a new scarf, it's nice.

385
00:36:15,474 --> 00:36:16,474
Thank you.

386
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:48,858
Dr. Trask.

387
00:37:48,859 --> 00:37:49,860
One second.

388
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,497
We added some names
to the Paris meeting.

389
00:37:58,565 --> 00:37:59,565
Thank you.

390
00:38:00,967 --> 00:38:02,367
Is something wrong Sir?

391
00:38:03,284 --> 00:38:05,363
No, it's nothing.

392
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:10,160
Would you mind taping up my
itinerary? I don't wanna miss anything.

393
00:38:22,153 --> 00:38:23,234
Stop! Don't get used to it.

394
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,529
What has he done now?

395
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:45,469
I'll just write you a
check for whatever he took.

396
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:47,096
We just need talk to him.

397
00:38:49,278 --> 00:38:52,888
Peter, the cops are here, again.

398
00:39:01,819 --> 00:39:03,124
I didn't do anything.

399
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,593
I've been here all day.

400
00:39:05,796 --> 00:39:07,532
Just relax Peter, we're not cops.

401
00:39:07,533 --> 00:39:09,862
Course you're not cops, if you were
cops you wouldn't drive a rental car.

402
00:39:09,863 --> 00:39:11,128
How'd you know we
got a rental car?

403
00:39:11,129 --> 00:39:13,246
I checked your registration when
you were walking through the door.

404
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:15,034
I also had some time to kill so I
went through your rental agreements.

405
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,085
Saw you were from out of town,
are you FBI?

406
00:39:18,326 --> 00:39:20,780
No, you're not cops, hey
what's up with this gypsy place?

407
00:39:20,781 --> 00:39:23,131
That's an old card.

408
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:25,357
Well he's fascinating.

409
00:39:25,358 --> 00:39:26,358
He's a pain in the ass.

410
00:39:26,537 --> 00:39:27,537
What, a teleporter?

411
00:39:27,538 --> 00:39:31,180
No, he's just fast but when
I knew him he wasn't so young.

412
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,586
Young, you're just old.

413
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:37,068
So you're not afraid
to show your powers?

414
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:39,338
Powers!, what powers?,
what are you talking about?

415
00:39:39,491 --> 00:39:41,491
Did you see something
strange here?

416
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,230
Nothing anybody would
believe you if you told them.

417
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,690
So who are you and
what do you want?

418
00:39:49,837 --> 00:39:50,973
We need your help, Peter.

419
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:51,967
With what?

420
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:55,547
Break into a highly secured
facility and get someone out.

421
00:39:55,998 --> 00:39:56,999
Prison break.

422
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,133
That's illegal you know.

423
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,933
Well, only if you get caught.

424
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,435
So what's in it for me?

425
00:40:06,436 --> 00:40:09,970
You, the kleptomaniac,
get to break into the Pentagon.

426
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:17,542
How do I know I can trust you?

427
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:20,055
Because we're just like you.

428
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:22,933
Show him.

429
00:40:35,312 --> 00:40:37,046
It's cool, just disgusting.

430
00:40:38,944 --> 00:40:42,934
Built in 1943 the Pentagon is the
world's largest office building housing.

431
00:40:42,946 --> 00:40:46,947
More than 25000 military and police
stretched over 6 million square feet.

432
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:50,163
Where is the bathroom?

433
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:57,586
Yeah, we're getting broadcast
signal down here, what's going on?

434
00:41:57,587 --> 00:42:00,521
Damn it, call maintenance,
get him down here.

435
00:44:01,687 --> 00:44:05,883
In 3 seconds those doors are going to open
and 20 guards will be here to shoot us.

436
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,202
I know,
that's what I'm waiting for.

437
00:44:09,203 --> 00:44:10,185
What are you doing?

438
00:44:10,186 --> 00:44:11,879
I'm holding your neck so
you won't get whiplash.

439
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,880
What?

440
00:44:13,121 --> 00:44:15,335
Whip... lash.

441
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:20,792
Don't move!

442
00:44:36,461 --> 00:44:37,766
You're good, it'll pass.

443
00:44:38,139 --> 00:44:39,139
It happens with everyone.

444
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:43,861
Must have done
something pretty serious.

445
00:44:43,862 --> 00:44:44,863
What'd you do?

446
00:44:45,222 --> 00:44:46,914
What'd you do?

447
00:44:47,327 --> 00:44:48,487
Why'd they have you in there?

448
00:44:48,574 --> 00:44:50,241
For killing the President.

449
00:44:55,253 --> 00:44:58,828
The only thing I'm guilty of
is fighting for people like us.

450
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:00,568
You take karate,
you're a karate man?

451
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:03,536
I don't know karate,
but I know crazy.

452
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:07,902
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and
girls this is a code red situation.

453
00:45:08,149 --> 00:45:11,278
We are evacuating the
entire floor so that we...

454
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:14,433
my uh associate and I can
uh secure the prisoner.

455
00:45:14,569 --> 00:45:15,119
Who are you?

456
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:19,241
We are special operations CB,
FE, CIE.

457
00:45:19,242 --> 00:45:22,418
Look, perhaps you didn't hear
me at first but it's imperative

458
00:45:22,430 --> 00:45:25,616
that, you understand we're in
complete lock-down situation.

459
00:45:25,617 --> 00:45:26,897
We have to get to the 3rd floor.

460
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:36,845
Oh I'm sorry were you finished.

461
00:45:41,811 --> 00:45:43,812
They told me you control metal.

462
00:45:44,090 --> 00:45:45,090
They?

463
00:45:48,141 --> 00:45:51,475
You know, my mom once knew
a guy who could do that.

464
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:56,880
Sorry, I'm just not
very good with violence.

465
00:45:59,977 --> 00:46:00,977
Charles.

466
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:10,019
Good to see you too old friend...

467
00:46:10,082 --> 00:46:11,082
and walking.

468
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:12,150
No thanks to you.

469
00:46:14,362 --> 00:46:16,959
You're the last person in the
world I expected to see today.

470
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,960
Believe me.

471
00:46:18,198 --> 00:46:20,208
I wouldn't be here
if I didn't have to.

472
00:46:20,209 --> 00:46:23,663
If we get you out of here
we do it my way, no killing.

473
00:46:23,664 --> 00:46:25,459
No helmet.

474
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,489
I couldn't disobey
you even if I wanted.

475
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,357
I'm never getting inside
of that head again.

476
00:46:31,558 --> 00:46:33,026
I need your word, Eric.

477
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,570
Nobody move.

478
00:46:38,223 --> 00:46:39,490
Hold it right there.

479
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:42,882
Charles.

480
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,883
Don't move.

481
00:46:44,171 --> 00:46:46,275
Hands up or we will shoot.

482
00:46:46,276 --> 00:46:47,364
Freeze them Charles.

483
00:46:47,365 --> 00:46:48,366
I can't.

484
00:46:54,057 --> 00:46:55,057
No.

485
00:48:48,424 --> 00:48:49,424
Thanks kid.

486
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:56,311
Peter thank you very very much.

487
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:57,680
You take care.

488
00:48:57,681 --> 00:48:59,582
Why are you going to Paris?

489
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,809
Imagine if they were metal.

490
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:16,511
Do me a favor and
return it for me.

491
00:49:16,934 --> 00:49:17,934
And Peter.

492
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:19,583
Take it slow.

493
00:49:21,067 --> 00:49:22,734
Where did they dig you up?

494
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:28,486
You're gonna find this hard
to believe but uh, you sent me.

495
00:49:29,831 --> 00:49:32,787
You and Charles, from the future.

496
00:49:56,092 --> 00:49:57,493
How did you lose them

497
00:49:58,406 --> 00:50:01,006
the treatment for my
spine fixed my DNA.

498
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:06,410
You sacrificed your
power so you could walk.

499
00:50:06,611 --> 00:50:09,411
I sacrificed my power
so that I could sl..

500
00:50:12,530 --> 00:50:13,530
What do you know about it?

501
00:50:13,531 --> 00:50:14,863
I lost my fair share.

502
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:15,971
Hah...

503
00:50:16,524 --> 00:50:17,724
Dry your eyes. Eric!

504
00:50:18,411 --> 00:50:20,373
Doesn't justify what you've done.

505
00:50:20,374 --> 00:50:21,909
You have no idea what I've done.

506
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:24,240
I know that you took the
things that mean most to me.

507
00:50:24,241 --> 00:50:27,001
Well maybe you should have
fought harder for them.

508
00:50:27,002 --> 00:50:29,523
Do you want to fight? Eric. I
will give you a fight. Sit down...

509
00:50:29,535 --> 00:50:30,535
let him come.

510
00:50:30,725 --> 00:50:31,792
You abandoned me.

511
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:34,773
You took her away
and you abandoned me.

512
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:41,167
Angel, Azazel, Emma, Banshee...

513
00:50:42,866 --> 00:50:45,613
our mutant brothers
and sisters... all dead,

514
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:52,384
captured, experimented on,
butchered.

515
00:50:52,385 --> 00:50:53,385
Eric.

516
00:50:53,505 --> 00:50:54,972
Where were you Charles?

517
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:57,601
We were supposed to protect them.

518
00:50:57,908 --> 00:50:59,872
Where were you when your
own people needed you.

519
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:01,789
Hiding.

520
00:51:01,917 --> 00:51:02,918
You and Hank.

521
00:51:03,141 --> 00:51:04,743
Pretending you were
something you're not.

522
00:51:04,858 --> 00:51:05,858
Eric.

523
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:10,642
You abandoned us all.

524
00:51:31,467 --> 00:51:33,401
So you were always an asshole.

525
00:51:36,216 --> 00:51:38,683
I take it we're best
buddies in the future.

526
00:51:40,386 --> 00:51:43,853
I spent a lot of years
trying to bring you down, bub.

527
00:51:44,078 --> 00:51:45,878
How's that work out for you?

528
00:51:45,907 --> 00:51:46,908
You're like me.

529
00:51:48,825 --> 00:51:49,958
You're a survivor.

530
00:51:54,771 --> 00:51:56,304
Wanna pick all that shit up?

531
00:52:16,686 --> 00:52:17,686
I'm sorry..

532
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:21,410
No. It was my fault.

533
00:54:55,047 --> 00:54:56,048
Fancy a game

534
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:57,609
been a while.

535
00:54:57,633 --> 00:55:00,234
I'm not in the mood
for games thank you.

536
00:55:06,464 --> 00:55:08,431
Haven't had a real
sip in 10 years.

537
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,110
I didn't kill the President.

538
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,802
The bullet curved Eric.

539
00:55:26,926 --> 00:55:29,059
Because I was trying to save him.

540
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:31,343
They took me out before I could.

541
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:32,505
Why would you try and save him?

542
00:55:32,506 --> 00:55:34,106
Because he was one of us.

543
00:55:46,452 --> 00:55:48,321
You must think me so foolish.

544
00:55:50,629 --> 00:55:52,191
We always said they
would come after us.

545
00:55:52,286 --> 00:55:55,754
I never imagined they would
use Raven's DNA to do it.

546
00:55:57,017 --> 00:55:58,057
When did you last see her?

547
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:03,180
The day I left for Dallas.

548
00:56:04,907 --> 00:56:05,907
And how was she?

549
00:56:07,992 --> 00:56:12,594
Strong, driven, loyal.

550
00:56:13,057 --> 00:56:14,057
How, how was she?

551
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:18,742
She was...

552
00:56:25,823 --> 00:56:28,483
I could see why she
had so much talent?

553
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,154
You should be proud
of her Charles.

554
00:56:34,127 --> 00:56:35,691
She's out there
fighting for our cause.

555
00:56:35,692 --> 00:56:36,693
Your cause?

556
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,339
The girl I raise,
she was not capable of killing.

557
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,805
You didn't raise her,
you grew up with her.

558
00:56:42,806 --> 00:56:45,042
She couldn't stay a little girl
forever that's why she left.

559
00:56:45,043 --> 00:56:48,337
She left because you
got inside her head.

560
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:51,397
That's not my power.

561
00:56:54,021 --> 00:56:55,226
She made a choice.

562
00:56:55,227 --> 00:56:58,244
But now we know where that
choice leads, don't we?

563
00:56:58,245 --> 00:57:00,737
She's going to murder
Trask, they're going to...

564
00:57:00,749 --> 00:57:03,252
capture her, and then they're
going to wipe us out.

565
00:57:04,105 --> 00:57:05,772
Not if we get to her first.

566
00:57:07,387 --> 00:57:09,587
Not if we change
history tomorrow.

567
00:57:15,053 --> 00:57:16,186
I'm sorry Charles.

568
00:57:21,124 --> 00:57:23,736
For what happened, I truly am.

569
00:57:27,864 --> 00:57:30,133
It's been a while since I played.

570
00:57:32,884 --> 00:57:34,151
I'll go easy on you.

571
00:57:36,124 --> 00:57:37,364
Might finally get a fair fight.

572
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:40,671
You have the first move.

573
00:57:55,659 --> 00:57:59,188
The diplomats all around the world are
arriving here today, at the hotel royale.

574
00:58:00,126 --> 00:58:01,954
A historic day as the
official ending of the...

575
00:58:01,966 --> 00:58:03,807
United States' fierce
involvement in Vietnam.

576
00:58:03,808 --> 00:58:05,747
There's the South
vietnamese foreign minister

577
00:58:05,759 --> 00:58:07,709
with other South
vietnamese dignitaries.

578
00:58:11,873 --> 00:58:14,402
The summit doesn't
begin for another hour.

579
00:58:14,427 --> 00:58:17,406
The hotel has arranged a private
room upstairs for your special guest.

580
00:58:17,431 --> 00:58:18,664
There will be plenty of time.

581
00:58:23,676 --> 00:58:26,563
Good afternoon everyone,
hello, thank you for coming.

582
00:58:28,013 --> 00:58:30,346
Congratulations on
winning this war.

583
00:58:30,777 --> 00:58:33,949
Now I know you all have
hands to shake and photos

584
00:58:33,961 --> 00:58:37,145
to take downstairs so I
will get right to the point.

585
00:58:38,241 --> 00:58:40,276
There is a new enemy out there.

586
00:58:40,277 --> 00:58:43,575
An enemy that will render
your arsenals useless,

587
00:58:43,587 --> 00:58:46,895
your armies powerless and
your nations defenseless.

588
00:58:52,384 --> 00:58:54,495
You'll need a new
weapon for this war.

589
00:58:54,496 --> 00:58:55,896
I call them Sentinels.

590
00:58:58,129 --> 00:59:03,063
Named after the ancient guardians
that stood at the gates of the Citadel.

591
00:59:04,301 --> 00:59:07,795
They have the aeronautic
capabilities of a harrier jet,

592
00:59:07,796 --> 00:59:10,826
armed with guns that can
fire off more than 2000

593
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:13,877
rounds per minute with
thermo-ceramic ammunition.

594
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:18,854
But size, power, speed, you can
find that at Lockheed or Boeing.

595
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:24,902
No, what makes the sentinels so special
is the ability to target the Mutant-X gene.

596
00:59:25,811 --> 00:59:29,964
A genetic guidance system that can
lock onto a mark half a mile away

597
00:59:29,965 --> 00:59:32,839
and won't trigger unless it
has identified the target.

598
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:36,780
With this weapon there'll be
no human collateral damage.

599
00:59:36,905 --> 00:59:40,153
If I turn it on the system
couldn't even activate in here

600
00:59:47,249 --> 00:59:50,575
unless there's a mutant.

601
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:01,854
There has to be
some kind of mistake.

602
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,521
My machines don't make mistakes.

603
01:00:09,415 --> 01:00:10,415
What are you?

604
01:00:11,709 --> 01:00:12,709
I assure you.

605
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:16,631
No don't shoot it.

606
01:00:18,056 --> 01:00:20,263
I don't know what
you're talking about.

607
01:00:54,606 --> 01:00:55,606
Raven.

608
01:01:00,978 --> 01:01:01,979
Raven.

609
01:01:07,076 --> 01:01:08,076
Raven.

610
01:01:10,485 --> 01:01:11,486
Charles.

611
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,843
We've come for you,
Eric and I, together.

612
01:01:15,936 --> 01:01:20,025
I never thought I
could see you again.

613
01:01:35,151 --> 01:01:38,808
I'm going to keep you safe I'm
going to keep you out of their hands.

614
01:01:42,048 --> 01:01:43,048
Eric.

615
01:01:45,709 --> 01:01:47,310
Eric, what are you doing?

616
01:01:48,364 --> 01:01:49,631
Securing our future.

617
01:01:50,253 --> 01:01:54,681
Forgive me Mystique, as long as
you're out there we'll never be safe.

618
01:01:56,165 --> 01:01:57,165
Eric.

619
01:01:57,189 --> 01:01:58,990
Use your powers Charles,
stop him.

620
01:01:59,313 --> 01:02:00,313
He can't.

621
01:02:31,312 --> 01:02:32,722
He's slipping he's slipping back.

622
01:03:15,731 --> 01:03:16,731
Stryker!

623
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,102
Restrain him.

624
01:03:39,813 --> 01:03:40,815
No.

625
01:03:42,017 --> 01:03:43,017
Eric.

626
01:03:53,525 --> 01:03:54,526
Where am I?

627
01:03:57,219 --> 01:03:58,609
How the hell did I get here?

628
01:03:58,732 --> 01:04:00,683
What, you came to us?

629
01:04:01,089 --> 01:04:02,090
Who are you?

630
01:04:02,091 --> 01:04:02,756
Charles.

631
01:04:02,757 --> 01:04:04,175
Charles Xavier.

632
01:04:04,176 --> 01:04:05,243
I don't know you.

633
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:07,626
The hell is that.

634
01:04:07,627 --> 01:04:12,306
Whoa whoa, I can deal with
this, just go, stop Eric.

635
01:04:14,492 --> 01:04:15,493
I'm sorry.

636
01:04:35,776 --> 01:04:37,833
You're Logan, that's
Hank McCoy, I'm Charles.

637
01:04:37,845 --> 01:04:39,914
Xavier, you spent the last
couple of days with us.

638
01:04:43,912 --> 01:04:44,912
You're on acid.

639
01:04:46,303 --> 01:04:48,503
Somebody gave you
really bad acid.

640
01:04:49,734 --> 01:04:50,735
Yeah?

641
01:05:35,032 --> 01:05:37,167
Just hold on tight we'll
get through this together.

642
01:05:39,047 --> 01:05:40,047
Oh God, Kitty.

643
01:05:42,207 --> 01:05:43,314
She's wounded pretty bad.

644
01:06:48,689 --> 01:06:50,416
I got him back.

645
01:06:54,901 --> 01:06:55,901
Professor.

646
01:06:56,214 --> 01:06:57,215
What happened to you?

647
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,541
I just saw someone who's going
to bring me a lot of pain someday.

648
01:07:04,919 --> 01:07:05,919
Where's Raven?

649
01:07:06,276 --> 01:07:07,275
Gone.

650
01:07:07,276 --> 01:07:07,776
Why?

651
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:09,524
We have to get out of here.

652
01:07:18,959 --> 01:07:20,920
Yesterday the Paris
peace summit was rocked...

653
01:07:20,932 --> 01:07:22,904
by the appearance of
unidentified assailants.

654
01:07:23,501 --> 01:07:25,221
The likes of which the
world has never seen.

655
01:07:25,597 --> 01:07:28,017
Mass hysteria has gripped
the nation as people ask:

656
01:07:28,029 --> 01:07:30,461
Where do they come
from, will they be back?

657
01:07:30,815 --> 01:07:33,336
And most importantly
are they friend or foe?

658
01:07:40,387 --> 01:07:42,168
What the hell are
we dealing with here.

659
01:07:42,169 --> 01:07:43,169
Off the record.

660
01:07:43,652 --> 01:07:46,990
2 days ago this man
Eric Lehnsherr

661
01:07:47,045 --> 01:07:49,577
escaped from a maximum
prison inside the Pentagon.

662
01:07:49,975 --> 01:07:53,650
We believe that this woman is a
former associate of Lehnsherr's.

663
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:57,211
They were together in Cuba at
the day of the crisis in '62.

664
01:07:57,302 --> 01:07:59,895
He was also linked to
the Kennedy assassination.

665
01:08:03,521 --> 01:08:04,921
What about that thing?

666
01:08:05,064 --> 01:08:06,064
We don't know what
that thing is Sir.

667
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,426
Actually we really don't
know what any of them are.

668
01:08:08,759 --> 01:08:11,397
Yes, yes we do.

669
01:08:12,086 --> 01:08:13,086
They're mutants.

670
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:18,458
He has the power to control
metal last I checked.

671
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,636
That's what most of your
weapons were made of.

672
01:08:22,536 --> 01:08:24,938
And she can
transform into anyone.

673
01:08:26,312 --> 01:08:30,912
A general, a secret service
man, even you Mr. President.

674
01:08:31,362 --> 01:08:35,516
She could walk into this office and order
a nuclear strike if she was in the mood.

675
01:08:36,312 --> 01:08:38,223
And that's only two of them.

676
01:08:38,224 --> 01:08:40,474
Well, do we have any
countermeasures, any defense?

677
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:42,486
I was waiting for you
to ask me that question.

678
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:47,372
That's an experimental
program, strictly off the books.

679
01:08:56,914 --> 01:08:59,247
You're telling me these
mutants are out in the world

680
01:08:59,259 --> 01:09:01,606
and our best defense are
these giant metal robots.

681
01:09:01,822 --> 01:09:04,022
Many of the mutants
looks like us

682
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:06,665
my sentinels can
tell the difference.

683
01:09:06,888 --> 01:09:09,646
I have 8 prototypes ready
to go, they're built out of

684
01:09:09,658 --> 01:09:12,425
a space age polymer, not
an ounce of metal on them.

685
01:09:19,628 --> 01:09:23,020
I wanna make a demonstration, I want the
world to know that we can protect them.

686
01:09:23,929 --> 01:09:25,196
What do you need to get
these things operational.

687
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,621
I already gave that
number to congress.

688
01:09:26,863 --> 01:09:29,664
Unfortunately they
elected to shut me down.

689
01:09:29,927 --> 01:09:32,590
It's going to cost a
bit more to turn them on.

690
01:09:32,622 --> 01:09:33,622
Whatever you need.

691
01:09:33,674 --> 01:09:37,354
Oh and one more thing, if we
do manage to capture them.

692
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:41,056
I would like her for
research purposes of course.

693
01:09:46,658 --> 01:09:47,759
How terrible?

694
01:09:49,559 --> 01:09:50,859
What?

695
01:09:51,059 --> 01:09:52,861
I mean, to be like that?

696
01:09:53,061 --> 01:09:54,061
Like that?

697
01:09:54,626 --> 01:09:56,726
Can you imagine?

698
01:09:56,926 --> 01:09:59,327
How can she even look in the mirror?

699
01:10:00,527 --> 01:10:02,928
Yes, I can.

700
01:10:05,729 --> 01:10:07,629
From where did she come from?

701
01:10:08,729 --> 01:10:09,890
You think she has any family?

702
01:10:13,031 --> 01:10:16,032
Yes, she does..

703
01:11:04,807 --> 01:11:08,240
If I see so much as a screw
I'll jam this into your throat.

704
01:11:10,069 --> 01:11:11,069
How did you find me?

705
01:11:11,365 --> 01:11:12,565
You taught me well.

706
01:11:13,123 --> 01:11:15,263
It's been a long time
since we were this close.

707
01:11:17,004 --> 01:11:18,004
I missed you.

708
01:11:18,467 --> 01:11:19,533
You tried to kill me.

709
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:21,610
So the rest of us could live.

710
01:11:23,932 --> 01:11:24,932
What do you mean?

711
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:27,450
I received a message
from the future.

712
01:11:27,451 --> 01:11:29,529
Don't lie to me.

713
01:11:29,741 --> 01:11:31,894
I never lied and I never will.

714
01:11:34,213 --> 01:11:38,428
Humans use your blood, your genes to
create a weapon that wipes us all out.

715
01:11:39,385 --> 01:11:42,157
I was only doing what I thought
necessary to secure our future.

716
01:11:42,409 --> 01:11:45,404
So what's to stop me from killing
you right now and securing my future.

717
01:11:47,128 --> 01:11:48,129
Nothing.

718
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:52,299
It doesn't matter anymore,
they have your DNA.

719
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,068
Your blood was on the street.

720
01:11:55,155 --> 01:11:56,156
Whose fault was that?

721
01:11:57,662 --> 01:11:58,891
Mine.

722
01:12:00,488 --> 01:12:01,488
I've seen their plans.

723
01:12:02,289 --> 01:12:06,333
They're creating a weapon and now they
have what they need to take it further.

724
01:12:09,066 --> 01:12:12,801
We have to strike now while
we still hold the upper hand.

725
01:12:15,488 --> 01:12:16,889
I've seen too many
friends die Eric.

726
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:20,164
I don't want a war.

727
01:12:21,978 --> 01:12:23,478
I only want the man
who murdered them.

728
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:24,530
This is war.

729
01:12:26,967 --> 01:12:28,300
What happened to you?

730
01:12:29,838 --> 01:12:31,470
Did you lose your
way when I was gone?

731
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:35,752
Are you still Charles' Raven?

732
01:12:38,305 --> 01:12:39,769
Or are you Mystique.

733
01:12:44,003 --> 01:12:45,996
Trask is the enemy.

734
01:12:47,471 --> 01:12:49,339
Killing one man isn't enough.

735
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:51,453
It never was for you.

736
01:12:53,066 --> 01:12:54,066
Goodbye Eric.

737
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:20,813
What happened?

738
01:13:21,475 --> 01:13:23,382
- Can he walk?
- He need his treatment.

739
01:13:24,072 --> 01:13:25,397
Hank, I can hear them.

740
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:27,668
It's ok, I'll make it stop.
I'll get it.

741
01:13:31,213 --> 01:13:34,081
Hey, hey, pull yourself
together it's not over yet.

742
01:13:38,498 --> 01:13:39,965
You don't believe that.

743
01:13:41,822 --> 01:13:42,822
How do you know?

744
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:43,955
As these go,

745
01:13:46,654 --> 01:13:48,946
this comes back.

746
01:13:50,711 --> 01:13:52,294
They all come back.

747
01:13:58,146 --> 01:13:59,147
Look.

748
01:14:00,299 --> 01:14:01,299
I'm still here.

749
01:14:02,969 --> 01:14:04,369
She's still out there.

750
01:14:06,674 --> 01:14:07,875
But we need your help Charles.

751
01:14:09,249 --> 01:14:11,116
Not like this, I'll need "you".

752
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,294
We can't find Raven
not without your powers.

753
01:14:18,755 --> 01:14:20,598
I added a little extra
cause you missed a dose.

754
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:27,238
Charles.

755
01:14:58,649 --> 01:15:00,094
Hank! do me a favor.

756
01:15:01,661 --> 01:15:04,329
Would you help me
to my study please?

757
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:22,442
Are you sure about this?

758
01:15:24,544 --> 01:15:25,544
Absolutely not.

759
01:15:32,996 --> 01:15:34,678
This creature is extraordinary.

760
01:15:36,674 --> 01:15:39,807
Her genes could hold the
key to mutation itself.

761
01:15:40,372 --> 01:15:41,373
I need more.

762
01:15:41,775 --> 01:15:44,216
That's all they were able to
scrape off the pavement in Paris.

763
01:15:44,548 --> 01:15:45,548
More than blood.

764
01:15:46,086 --> 01:15:51,079
I need brain tissue,
spinal fluid, bone marrow.

765
01:15:52,125 --> 01:15:56,090
Imagine sentinels that could
transform, adapt to any target.

766
01:15:56,719 --> 01:15:58,119
If I could just
get my hands on her.

767
01:15:58,535 --> 01:15:59,535
This girl,

768
01:16:00,213 --> 01:16:04,215
she could lead the program forward
years, decades into the future.

769
01:16:06,192 --> 01:16:07,432
How old is your son now, Major?

770
01:16:08,717 --> 01:16:09,718
Jason?

771
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:11,925
He's coming up on 10 now
if you can believe it.

772
01:16:11,926 --> 01:16:13,593
8 years from fighting age.

773
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:17,357
And how many of our sons and brothers
did we just ship home in body bags?

774
01:16:17,419 --> 01:16:19,371
Maybe 50/55 thousands.

775
01:16:19,372 --> 01:16:21,260
And how many more
on the other side?

776
01:16:22,776 --> 01:16:26,766
Never before in all of
human history has there.

777
01:16:26,778 --> 01:16:30,779
Been a cause which could
unite us as a species.

778
01:16:33,746 --> 01:16:34,746
Until now.

779
01:16:37,282 --> 01:16:38,927
You really hate mutants
doctor, don't you?

780
01:16:39,479 --> 01:16:40,479
On the contrary.

781
01:16:40,726 --> 01:16:42,059
I rather admire them.

782
01:16:42,298 --> 01:16:43,765
The things they can do.

783
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,041
I see mutants as our salvation.

784
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:50,181
A common enemy.

785
01:16:50,766 --> 01:16:53,542
A common struggle against
the ultimate enemy.

786
01:16:54,551 --> 01:16:55,551
Extinction.

787
01:16:57,098 --> 01:17:00,123
I believe our new friends are going
to help us Usher in a new era, Bill.

788
01:17:00,568 --> 01:17:04,717
A new era of genuine
and long lasting peace.

789
01:17:19,931 --> 01:17:21,254
Attention, Attention.

790
01:17:21,255 --> 01:17:23,256
Transport departure
begins in an hour.

791
01:17:23,351 --> 01:17:26,235
Repeat, transport
departure begins in an hour.

792
01:17:34,182 --> 01:17:36,496
When was the last time
you were down here?

793
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,787
The last time we went looking
for students a lifetime ago.

794
01:17:45,959 --> 01:17:47,093
Welcome Professor!

795
01:18:11,518 --> 01:18:13,477
Raven is wounded,
she won't be moving fast.

796
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:25,222
These are muscles I haven't
stretched in a long time.

797
01:18:45,032 --> 01:18:46,032
God.

798
01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:12,512
Charles.

799
01:19:20,594 --> 01:19:21,994
Charles, it's alright.

800
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:28,664
I'll go check the generator.

801
01:19:36,146 --> 01:19:38,013
It's not the machinery is it?

802
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:40,845
I can't do this, my mind..
Yes you can.

803
01:19:40,846 --> 01:19:41,847
It won't take it.

804
01:19:42,165 --> 01:19:43,246
You're just a little rusty.

805
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:45,501
You don't understand, it's
not a question of being rusty.

806
01:19:45,696 --> 01:19:47,456
I can flip the switches,
I can turn the knobs

807
01:19:47,717 --> 01:19:50,257
but my power comes from here,
it comes from

808
01:19:52,135 --> 01:19:53,135
and it's broken.

809
01:19:54,817 --> 01:19:56,268
I feel like one of my students.

810
01:19:56,808 --> 01:19:58,165
Helpless!

811
01:19:59,857 --> 01:20:02,457
It was a mistake coming down here,
it was a mistake bringing Eric.

812
01:20:02,483 --> 01:20:04,816
This whole thing has
been one bloody mistake.

813
01:20:04,817 --> 01:20:07,318
I'm sorry Logan, but they
sent back the wrong man.

814
01:20:08,435 --> 01:20:09,435
You're right.

815
01:20:11,262 --> 01:20:12,262
I am.

816
01:20:13,594 --> 01:20:15,861
Actually it was
supposed to be you

817
01:20:16,278 --> 01:20:19,379
but I was the only one who
could physically make the trip.

818
01:20:20,716 --> 01:20:23,244
And uh, I don't know
how long we've got here,

819
01:20:23,982 --> 01:20:28,132
but I do know that a long time
a, actually, a long time from now.

820
01:20:30,153 --> 01:20:32,287
I was your lost helpless student

821
01:20:33,589 --> 01:20:35,847
and you unlocked my mind.

822
01:20:36,253 --> 01:20:39,987
You showed me what I was,
you showed me what I could be.

823
01:20:40,977 --> 01:20:43,109
I don't know how
to do that for you.

824
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,510
You're right, I don't.

825
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:48,960
But I know someone who might.

826
01:20:51,293 --> 01:20:53,449
Look into my mind.

827
01:20:54,405 --> 01:20:56,338
You saw what I did to Cerebro.

828
01:20:56,580 --> 01:20:57,932
You don't want me
inside your head.

829
01:20:57,933 --> 01:21:00,770
There's no damage you can do that
hasn't already been done, trust me.

830
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:14,180
Hi.

831
01:21:16,421 --> 01:21:17,420
Hey Logan.

832
01:21:17,421 --> 01:21:18,422
Hi... Jean.

833
01:21:19,134 --> 01:21:20,133
Kill me.

834
01:21:20,134 --> 01:21:21,134
I love you.

835
01:21:23,856 --> 01:21:25,323
Why you poor...

836
01:21:27,710 --> 01:21:28,709
poor man?

837
01:21:28,710 --> 01:21:29,710
Look past me.

838
01:21:29,744 --> 01:21:33,982
No I don't want your suffering
I don't want your future.

839
01:21:34,270 --> 01:21:36,341
Look past my future.

840
01:21:36,738 --> 01:21:38,072
Look for your future.

841
01:21:42,339 --> 01:21:43,339
That's it.

842
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,041
That's it.

843
01:22:36,240 --> 01:22:37,241
Charles.

844
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:40,955
Charles.

845
01:22:45,272 --> 01:22:47,206
So this is what becomes of us.

846
01:22:49,141 --> 01:22:50,323
Eric was right.

847
01:22:51,803 --> 01:22:53,403
Humanity does this to us.

848
01:22:53,624 --> 01:22:55,825
Not if we show
them a better path.

849
01:22:57,730 --> 01:22:58,863
You still believe.

850
01:22:59,082 --> 01:23:04,393
Just because someone stumbles, loses their
way, it doesn't mean they're lost forever.

851
01:23:05,498 --> 01:23:08,882
Sometimes we all
need a little help.

852
01:23:10,233 --> 01:23:11,661
I'm not the man I was.

853
01:23:14,271 --> 01:23:15,906
I open my mind.

854
01:23:16,458 --> 01:23:18,850
It almost overwhelms me.

855
01:23:19,215 --> 01:23:20,215
You're afraid

856
01:23:21,205 --> 01:23:22,538
and Cerebro knows it.

857
01:23:23,485 --> 01:23:25,469
All those voices.

858
01:23:28,278 --> 01:23:31,210
So much

859
01:23:31,563 --> 01:23:32,563
pain.

860
01:23:33,342 --> 01:23:35,743
It's not their pain
you're afraid of.

861
01:23:36,812 --> 01:23:38,285
It's yours, Charles.

862
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,783
And as frightening as it may be.

863
01:23:42,758 --> 01:23:44,958
Their pain will
make you stronger.

864
01:23:45,864 --> 01:23:48,139
If you allow yourself to feel it,

865
01:23:49,284 --> 01:23:50,426
embrace it.

866
01:23:51,979 --> 01:23:55,330
It will make you more powerful
than you ever imagined.

867
01:23:56,303 --> 01:23:59,193
It's the greatest gift we have.

868
01:23:59,796 --> 01:24:02,723
To bear their pain
without breaking

869
01:24:03,947 --> 01:24:07,483
and it's born from
the most human power.

870
01:24:09,114 --> 01:24:10,115
Hope.

871
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:20,973
Please.

872
01:24:21,798 --> 01:24:25,464
Charles,
we need you to hope again.

873
01:24:34,741 --> 01:24:36,379
Find what you were looking for.

874
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:43,792
Power's back on.

875
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:45,310
Yes.

876
01:24:46,662 --> 01:24:47,808
Yes it is.

877
01:26:28,832 --> 01:26:30,499
She's lost too much blood.

878
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:31,908
She can't keep going like this.

879
01:26:31,909 --> 01:26:33,716
We have no choice Bobby.

880
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:35,393
We can wake him up.

881
01:26:35,548 --> 01:26:36,548
No.

882
01:26:37,572 --> 01:26:38,840
They need more time.

883
01:26:39,452 --> 01:26:43,541
I had a glimpse into the past.

884
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:49,343
If we wake Logan now we may
set off an even darker course.

885
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,612
They need more time.

886
01:27:10,855 --> 01:27:11,867
Raven, stop.

887
01:27:13,485 --> 01:27:14,485
Stop running.

888
01:27:15,406 --> 01:27:16,406
Charles.

889
01:27:18,394 --> 01:27:19,465
Where are you?

890
01:27:19,466 --> 01:27:21,941
Back at the house
where you should be.

891
01:27:23,145 --> 01:27:24,678
I need you to come home.

892
01:27:25,998 --> 01:27:27,600
I know what I need to do.

893
01:27:30,242 --> 01:27:34,124
If you kill Trask you'll be creating
countless more just like him.

894
01:27:34,125 --> 01:27:35,132
Then I'll kill them too.

895
01:27:35,133 --> 01:27:37,333
Those are Eric's words,
not yours.

896
01:27:41,671 --> 01:27:44,387
The girl I grew up with
wasn't capable of killing.

897
01:27:44,388 --> 01:27:46,921
She was good, fair,
full of compassion.

898
01:27:49,233 --> 01:27:50,366
I have compassion.

899
01:27:50,889 --> 01:27:52,089
Just not for Trask.

900
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:54,008
He's been murdering
too many of us.

901
01:27:58,396 --> 01:28:00,287
Shut her down Charles,
get in her head.

902
01:28:00,288 --> 01:28:01,822
She's not letting me in.

903
01:28:02,111 --> 01:28:04,191
I'm barely holding on,
I'm not strong enough yet.

904
01:28:13,394 --> 01:28:14,910
I know what Trask has done.

905
01:28:15,958 --> 01:28:18,459
But killing him will
not bring them back.

906
01:28:18,981 --> 01:28:21,958
It will set you on a path
from which there is no return.

907
01:28:22,778 --> 01:28:24,037
An endless cycle of killing.

908
01:28:24,038 --> 01:28:27,927
Us and them till
there is nothing left.

909
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:32,133
But we can stop it
right now you and I.

910
01:28:34,324 --> 01:28:36,191
You just "have" to come home.

911
01:28:38,638 --> 01:28:39,639
I "have" to.

912
01:28:40,819 --> 01:28:42,643
You haven't changed
at all Charles.

913
01:28:43,747 --> 01:28:46,854
Like I said, I know
exactly what I have to do.

914
01:29:02,673 --> 01:29:03,674
Where is she?

915
01:29:04,594 --> 01:29:05,853
At an airport boarding a plane.

916
01:29:06,725 --> 01:29:07,792
A plane to where?

917
01:29:11,163 --> 01:29:12,165
Washington DC.

918
01:29:14,465 --> 01:29:15,465
Hey guys.

919
01:29:16,019 --> 01:29:18,419
There's something
I need to show you.

920
01:29:20,337 --> 01:29:22,271
We're going backwards in time.

921
01:29:22,637 --> 01:29:25,108
This the system I
designed to record any

922
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:27,601
news about Paris over
all 3 networks and PBS.

923
01:29:28,403 --> 01:29:29,404
All 3? Wow.

924
01:29:30,301 --> 01:29:31,301
Yeah... and PBS.

925
01:29:33,369 --> 01:29:34,369
Look what I found.

926
01:29:35,016 --> 01:29:38,098
Tomorrow in front of the white house
the President will make his announcement.

927
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:41,062
He'll be joined by secretary
of defense Laird and has

928
01:29:41,074 --> 01:29:43,768
even sought the help of renowned
scientist Bolivar Trask

929
01:29:44,156 --> 01:29:46,668
his special advisor to
combat this mutant issue.

930
01:29:48,998 --> 01:29:51,220
Raven doesn't realize but
if she kills Trask at

931
01:29:51,232 --> 01:29:53,466
an event like that with
the whole world watching.

932
01:29:55,519 --> 01:29:57,071
Then I came a long
way for nothing.

933
01:29:58,184 --> 01:30:00,918
And there's more bad news,
I saw a report

934
01:30:00,945 --> 01:30:03,135
they found traces of
her blood in Paris.

935
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:05,870
For all we know they
already have her DNA.

936
01:30:06,077 --> 01:30:09,438
That's all they need to create
the sentinels in the future.

937
01:30:13,144 --> 01:30:15,856
Now there's a theory in time
physics that time is immutable.

938
01:30:17,096 --> 01:30:19,321
It's like a river, you can
throw a pebble and it will

939
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:21,570
create a ripple but the current
always corrects itself.

940
01:30:23,047 --> 01:30:26,348
No matter what you do the river just
keeps flowing in the same direction.

941
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:28,734
What are you trying to say?

942
01:30:28,735 --> 01:30:29,735
I'm saying that,

943
01:30:30,363 --> 01:30:32,297
what if the war is inevitable?

944
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:34,794
What if she's
meant to kill Trask?

945
01:30:36,456 --> 01:30:38,656
What if this is just
simply who she is?

946
01:30:40,841 --> 01:30:43,910
Just because someone stumbles,
loses their way

947
01:30:45,123 --> 01:30:47,323
doesn't mean
they're lost forever?

948
01:30:51,902 --> 01:30:53,645
No I don't believe
that theory Hank

949
01:30:55,561 --> 01:30:58,230
and I cannot believe
that that is who she is.

950
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:02,970
Ready the plane
we're going to Washington.

951
01:32:21,246 --> 01:32:22,326
You alright

952
01:32:22,920 --> 01:32:23,920
getting there.

953
01:32:29,053 --> 01:32:31,464
Whatever happens today I need
you to promise me something.

954
01:32:32,551 --> 01:32:37,487
You looked into my mind and you've seen
a lot of bad but you've seen the good too.

955
01:32:39,026 --> 01:32:40,293
The X-Men.

956
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:43,768
Promise me you'll find us.

957
01:32:45,514 --> 01:32:47,716
Use your power,
bring us together.

958
01:32:48,143 --> 01:32:49,276
Guide us, lead us.

959
01:32:51,965 --> 01:32:57,765
Storm, Scott, Jean

960
01:32:59,538 --> 01:33:00,872
remember those names.

961
01:33:02,612 --> 01:33:03,612
There's so many of us.

962
01:33:05,641 --> 01:33:07,374
We will need you Professor.

963
01:33:10,810 --> 01:33:12,874
I'll do my best.

964
01:33:13,425 --> 01:33:14,671
Your best is enough.

965
01:33:17,094 --> 01:33:18,095
Trust me.

966
01:33:43,182 --> 01:33:44,541
12 carriers inbound.

967
01:33:44,727 --> 01:33:45,728
10 Miles.

968
01:33:47,225 --> 01:33:48,339
They found us.

969
01:34:04,932 --> 01:34:07,337
Thousands of people will be
gathered here today they've

970
01:34:07,349 --> 01:34:09,764
come from all over the
world to witness history

971
01:34:09,765 --> 01:34:13,699
along with news crews from at
least 50 different countries.

972
01:34:18,740 --> 01:34:20,390
Can I see your
invitations please?

973
01:34:20,979 --> 01:34:21,981
Yes you may.

974
01:34:22,492 --> 01:34:23,732
These two are with me.

975
01:34:23,733 --> 01:34:24,319
Go ahead.

976
01:34:24,344 --> 01:34:25,344
Thank you.

977
01:34:32,543 --> 01:34:33,543
Logan.

978
01:34:33,747 --> 01:34:35,080
Please, this way Sir.

979
01:35:01,848 --> 01:35:04,393
Haven't found her yet
but she has to be here.

980
01:35:04,394 --> 01:35:06,663
The President of
the United States.

981
01:35:28,747 --> 01:35:30,014
My fellow Americans.

982
01:35:30,831 --> 01:35:35,082
Today we face the greatest
threat in our history.

983
01:35:35,616 --> 01:35:36,616
Mutants.

984
01:35:39,777 --> 01:35:41,912
We have prepared for this threat.

985
01:35:45,194 --> 01:35:48,061
In the immortal words
of Robert Oppenheimer.

986
01:35:49,100 --> 01:35:50,100
Behold.

987
01:35:50,628 --> 01:35:53,161
The world will never
be the same again.

988
01:36:24,099 --> 01:36:25,100
Can I help you?

989
01:36:28,569 --> 01:36:29,570
No you can't.

990
01:37:06,972 --> 01:37:08,266
Here they come.

991
01:37:15,097 --> 01:37:17,096
This for you
brothers and sisters.

992
01:37:19,910 --> 01:37:20,910
Raven.

993
01:37:23,764 --> 01:37:24,764
I have her.

994
01:37:25,276 --> 01:37:26,410
Let me go Charles.

995
01:37:28,782 --> 01:37:29,782
There, you see?

996
01:37:30,338 --> 01:37:32,354
Secret service man
left of the stage.

997
01:37:32,355 --> 01:37:33,356
Got it. Go.

998
01:37:54,652 --> 01:37:57,923
What the hell are you doing? I
didn't tell you to activate them.

999
01:37:57,924 --> 01:37:58,924
I didn't..

1000
01:38:17,053 --> 01:38:19,093
Raven please listen to me.

1001
01:38:19,378 --> 01:38:22,597
We've been given a second
chance to define who we are.

1002
01:38:25,841 --> 01:38:26,841
Don't do this.

1003
01:38:30,507 --> 01:38:32,163
Gentlemen,
you cannot pass this point.

1004
01:38:41,141 --> 01:38:42,675
We can't stop that many.

1005
01:38:42,810 --> 01:38:45,082
No, but we can slow them down.

1006
01:39:20,097 --> 01:39:21,830
What the hell is happening?

1007
01:39:23,896 --> 01:39:24,896
Eric.

1008
01:40:10,145 --> 01:40:11,146
Storm.

1009
01:40:48,789 --> 01:40:49,990
Take us to Def con 3.

1010
01:40:50,089 --> 01:40:52,800
Mr. President we are code red.

1011
01:40:54,685 --> 01:40:56,006
What the hell happened out there?

1012
01:40:56,135 --> 01:40:57,135
I will fix it.

1013
01:40:57,207 --> 01:40:58,207
You said that before.

1014
01:40:58,208 --> 01:40:59,663
I wanted to make a statement.

1015
01:40:59,664 --> 01:41:02,026
Now the whole goddamn world
knows we can't protect them.

1016
01:41:02,209 --> 01:41:03,849
I will fix it.

1017
01:41:03,850 --> 01:41:05,183
You damn well better.

1018
01:42:17,539 --> 01:42:18,539
Charles.

1019
01:43:06,757 --> 01:43:08,101
Is everybody ok?

1020
01:43:42,357 --> 01:43:43,357
Storm.

1021
01:43:46,971 --> 01:43:47,972
Behind you.

1022
01:44:32,811 --> 01:44:33,811
Now.

1023
01:44:34,570 --> 01:44:35,570
Go.

1024
01:44:57,756 --> 01:44:59,573
I'm probably not supposed
to ask this kinda thing,

1025
01:44:59,574 --> 01:45:01,362
but in the future

1026
01:45:02,147 --> 01:45:03,148
do I make it?

1027
01:45:03,404 --> 01:45:04,404
No.

1028
01:45:06,796 --> 01:45:08,663
But we can change it, right?

1029
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:21,856
Do what you were made for.

1030
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,392
Where are you?

1031
01:45:50,648 --> 01:45:51,648
I got this.

1032
01:45:51,776 --> 01:45:52,777
Go.

1033
01:46:36,203 --> 01:46:37,204
Oh dear God, no.

1034
01:46:53,609 --> 01:46:55,476
So much for being a survivor.

1035
01:47:38,458 --> 01:47:39,925
One of them is in here.

1036
01:47:40,864 --> 01:47:41,865
Gun.

1037
01:47:42,424 --> 01:47:44,157
No no no no, don't kill it.

1038
01:47:44,403 --> 01:47:45,404
I need it alive.

1039
01:47:59,502 --> 01:48:01,235
What the hell has happened?

1040
01:49:06,260 --> 01:49:08,582
You built these
weapons to destroy us.

1041
01:49:09,525 --> 01:49:10,526
Why?

1042
01:49:15,122 --> 01:49:17,202
Because you're
afraid of our gifts.

1043
01:49:18,141 --> 01:49:20,263
Because we are different.

1044
01:49:22,288 --> 01:49:24,289
Humanity has always feared
that which is different.

1045
01:49:26,494 --> 01:49:27,942
Well I'm here to tell you...

1046
01:49:27,943 --> 01:49:29,076
to tell the world...

1047
01:49:30,420 --> 01:49:31,955
you're right to fear us.

1048
01:49:33,012 --> 01:49:34,145
We are the future.

1049
01:49:35,452 --> 01:49:38,320
We are the ones who
will inherit this earth

1050
01:49:38,585 --> 01:49:41,154
and anyone who stands
in our way will suffer...

1051
01:49:41,166 --> 01:49:43,745
the same fate as these
men you see before you.

1052
01:49:51,305 --> 01:49:54,306
Today was meant to be
a display of your power...

1053
01:49:54,973 --> 01:50:00,575
instead I give you a glimpse of the
devastation my race can unleash upon yours.

1054
01:50:10,334 --> 01:50:12,601
Let this be a
warning to the world...

1055
01:50:13,194 --> 01:50:15,626
and to my mutant brothers
and sisters out there.

1056
01:50:16,635 --> 01:50:17,886
I say this...

1057
01:50:18,167 --> 01:50:19,167
no more hiding,

1058
01:50:20,564 --> 01:50:21,697
no more suffering.

1059
01:50:23,251 --> 01:50:27,385
You have lived in the shadows
and shame and fear for too long.

1060
01:50:28,098 --> 01:50:29,098
Come out.

1061
01:50:29,807 --> 01:50:30,807
Join me.

1062
01:50:31,287 --> 01:50:34,555
Fight together in the
brotherhood of our kind.

1063
01:50:34,911 --> 01:50:35,911
A new tomorrow.

1064
01:50:38,230 --> 01:50:39,363
That starts today.

1065
01:50:47,138 --> 01:50:50,606
All those years wasted
fighting each other Charles.

1066
01:50:54,774 --> 01:50:57,450
To have a precious
few of them back.

1067
01:51:37,314 --> 01:51:38,554
- Mr. President, no.
- Stand down.

1068
01:51:38,569 --> 01:51:39,702
I said stand down.

1069
01:51:42,365 --> 01:51:43,692
You wanna make a statement.

1070
01:51:44,240 --> 01:51:47,595
Kill me fine but
spare everyone else.

1071
01:52:00,857 --> 01:52:02,590
Very heroic, Mr. President.

1072
01:52:03,768 --> 01:52:06,405
But you have no intention
of sparing any of us.

1073
01:52:07,397 --> 01:52:10,615
The future of our
species begins now.

1074
01:52:46,273 --> 01:52:47,679
You used to be a better shot.

1075
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:49,013
Trust me, I still am.

1076
01:53:02,555 --> 01:53:04,288
Get out of my head Charles.

1077
01:53:04,386 --> 01:53:05,386
Raven.

1078
01:53:06,178 --> 01:53:08,348
Please,
do not make us the enemy today.

1079
01:53:08,349 --> 01:53:10,417
Look around you, we already are.

1080
01:53:10,586 --> 01:53:12,304
Not all of us.

1081
01:53:12,463 --> 01:53:16,704
All you've done so far is
save the lives of these men.

1082
01:53:18,093 --> 01:53:20,161
You can show them a better path.

1083
01:53:24,285 --> 01:53:25,285
Shut her down Charles.

1084
01:53:28,004 --> 01:53:31,873
I've been trying to control
you ever since the day we met.

1085
01:53:32,066 --> 01:53:33,799
And look what that's got us?

1086
01:53:36,485 --> 01:53:38,804
Everything that happens now

1087
01:53:39,693 --> 01:53:40,760
is in your hands.

1088
01:53:45,877 --> 01:53:48,547
I have faith in you, Raven.

1089
01:55:27,511 --> 01:55:28,979
He's all yours, Charles.

1090
01:55:57,249 --> 01:55:59,581
If you let them have me
I'm as good as dead.

1091
01:55:59,582 --> 01:56:00,582
You know that.

1092
01:56:01,879 --> 01:56:02,879
I know.

1093
01:56:05,222 --> 01:56:06,422
Goodbye old friend.

1094
01:56:09,393 --> 01:56:10,393
Goodbye Eric.

1095
01:56:44,571 --> 01:56:45,972
You sure you should let them go.

1096
01:56:47,789 --> 01:56:48,789
Yes.

1097
01:56:49,550 --> 01:56:50,884
I have hope for them.

1098
01:56:52,633 --> 01:56:54,038
There's going to be a time, Hank.

1099
01:56:54,473 --> 01:56:55,474
When we're all together.

1100
01:57:00,301 --> 01:57:01,368
What about Logan?

1101
01:58:32,407 --> 01:58:33,568
Good morning Logan.

1102
01:58:33,569 --> 01:58:34,569
Late start.

1103
01:58:46,731 --> 01:58:47,998
Good job thank you.

1104
01:58:48,126 --> 01:58:49,126
Very good job.

1105
01:58:50,450 --> 01:58:51,451
Storm.

1106
01:59:23,156 --> 01:59:24,157
Jean.

1107
01:59:25,352 --> 01:59:26,725
Hey Logan.

1108
01:59:28,935 --> 01:59:29,935
Are you okay?

1109
01:59:32,808 --> 01:59:33,808
You're here.

1110
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:36,271
Where else would I be?

1111
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:40,110
Whoa!

1112
01:59:40,967 --> 01:59:41,967
Easy pal.

1113
01:59:44,363 --> 01:59:45,963
Some things never change.

1114
01:59:48,376 --> 01:59:49,777
Good to see you Scott.

1115
01:59:51,781 --> 01:59:52,781
Uh huh.

1116
01:59:53,005 --> 01:59:54,005
Take it easy ok.

1117
01:59:58,404 --> 01:59:59,404
Professor.

1118
02:00:00,339 --> 02:00:01,339
Logan.

1119
02:00:01,874 --> 02:00:03,274
Is everything alright?

1120
02:00:06,620 --> 02:00:07,620
Yeah.

1121
02:00:09,230 --> 02:00:10,230
Yeah, I think it is.

1122
02:00:27,346 --> 02:00:28,658
You did it.

1123
02:00:28,849 --> 02:00:29,849
Did what?

1124
02:00:30,098 --> 02:00:32,631
Logan, don't you
have a class to teach?

1125
02:00:32,699 --> 02:00:33,900
A class to.. Teach?

1126
02:00:34,771 --> 02:00:36,200
Yeah, history.

1127
02:00:37,288 --> 02:00:38,288
History?

1128
02:00:39,641 --> 02:00:41,243
Actually I could use
some help with that.

1129
02:00:41,591 --> 02:00:42,591
Help with what?

1130
02:00:43,494 --> 02:00:46,881
Pretty much
everything after 1973.

1131
02:00:51,693 --> 02:00:54,360
The history I know
is a little different.

1132
02:00:56,275 --> 02:00:57,275
Welcome back.

1133
02:01:00,547 --> 02:01:02,415
It's good to see you Charles.

1134
02:01:03,531 --> 02:01:05,199
It's good to see everyone.

1135
02:01:05,725 --> 02:01:06,725
Well.

1136
02:01:07,822 --> 02:01:09,355
I had a promise to keep.

1137
02:01:11,223 --> 02:01:14,140
You and I have a lot
of catching up to do.

1138
02:01:14,694 --> 02:01:15,694
Yeah.

1139
02:01:20,417 --> 02:01:22,685
What's the last
thing you remember?

1140
02:01:27,600 --> 02:01:28,600
Drowning.

1141
02:01:38,118 --> 02:01:39,119
The past.

1142
02:01:40,510 --> 02:01:43,035
A new and unsettled world.

1143
02:01:54,931 --> 02:01:57,172
A world with endless
possibilities.

1144
02:01:59,612 --> 02:02:03,034
And infinite outcomes.

1145
02:02:03,660 --> 02:02:04,660
Isn't he?

1146
02:02:04,837 --> 02:02:05,837
Oh he's alive.

1147
02:02:10,903 --> 02:02:13,463
Countless choices
define our faith.

1148
02:02:14,534 --> 02:02:15,536
Each choice.

1149
02:02:15,785 --> 02:02:16,785
Each moment.

1150
02:02:17,154 --> 02:02:19,087
A ripple in the river of time.

1151
02:02:19,669 --> 02:02:22,312
What do you want us to do
with him, Major Stryker?

1152
02:02:22,313 --> 02:02:25,300
Enough ripples and
you change the tide.

1153
02:02:27,007 --> 02:02:28,380
I'll take him from here.

1154
02:02:28,381 --> 02:02:31,635
For the future is
never truly set.

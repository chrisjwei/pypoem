01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:30,634
They all turn out like you?

1078
01:14:30,801 --> 01:14:31,885
Worse.

1079
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:34,304
The doctor, could he control them?

1080
01:14:35,264 --> 01:14:36,682
Enough.

1081
01:14:36,849 --> 01:14:38,684
Said he wanted to see an empire fall.

1082
01:14:38,934 --> 01:14:40,561
BUCKY: With these guys, he could do it.

1083
01:14:40,853 --> 01:14:43,188
They speak 30 languages,
can hide in plain sight...

1084
01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:45,482
infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize.

1085
01:14:45,566 --> 01:14:47,109
They can take a whole country down

1086
01:14:47,192 --> 01:14:48,832
in one night,
you'd never see them coming.

1087
01:14:51,363 --> 01:14:53,407
This would have been
a lot easier a week ago.

1088
01:14:53,991 --> 01:14:56,118
- If we call Tony...
- No, he won't believe us.

1089
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:57,202
Even if he did...

1090
01:14:57,286 --> 01:14:59,079
Who knows if the Accords
would let him help.

1091
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:01,540
We're on our own.

1092
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:03,958
Maybe not.

1093
01:15:05,878 --> 01:15:07,421
I know a guy.

1094
01:15:08,380 --> 01:15:11,341
I don't suppose you have
any idea where they are?

1095
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:12,425
TONY: We will.

1096
01:15:12,593 --> 01:15:14,178
GSG 9's got the borders covered.

1097
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:16,054
Recon's flying 24/7.

1098
01:15:16,221 --> 01:15:17,723
They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.

1099
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:19,766
You don't get it, Stark.
It's not yours to handle.

1100
01:15:19,892 --> 01:15:22,227
It's clear you can't be objective.

1101
01:15:22,394 --> 01:15:23,896
I'm putting Special Ops on this.

1102
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:25,206
What happens
when the shooting starts?

1103
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,523
What, do you kill Steve Rogers?

1104
01:15:26,607 --> 01:15:27,967
SECRETARY ROSS: If we're provoked.

1105
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:31,403
Barnes would've been eliminated
in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers.

1106
01:15:31,570 --> 01:15:35,365
There are dead people
who would be alive now.

1107
01:15:36,450 --> 01:15:38,285
Feel free to check my math.

1108
01:15:38,493 --> 01:15:39,888
All due respect,
you're not gonna solve this

1109
01:15:39,912 --> 01:15:41,163
with boys and bullets, Ross.

1110
01:15:41,246 --> 01:15:42,486
You gotta let us bring them in.

1111
01:15:42,706 --> 01:15:44,666
How would that end
any differently than last time?

1112
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:45,791
Because this time,

1113
01:15:45,834 --> 01:15:47,554
I won't be wearing loafers
and a silk shirt.

1114
01:15:48,795 --> 01:15:50,672

1115
01:15:50,839 --> 01:15:52,674
36 hours.

1116
01:15:54,218 --> 01:15:55,510
Barnes.

1117
01:15:57,012 --> 01:15:58,347
Rogers.

1118
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:00,139
Wilson.

1119
01:16:00,182 --> 01:16:01,975
Thank you, sir.

1121
01:16:05,604 --> 01:16:07,481
My left arm is numb. Is that normal?

1122
01:16:10,943 --> 01:16:12,027
You all right?

1123
01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:13,278
Always.

1124
01:16:17,366 --> 01:16:19,618
36 hours. Jeez.

1125
01:16:19,785 --> 01:16:21,828
We're seriously understaffed.

1126
01:16:21,995 --> 01:16:23,163
Oh, yeah.

1127
01:16:23,330 --> 01:16:26,291
It'd be great if we had
a Hulk right about now. Any shot?

1128
01:16:28,252 --> 01:16:30,879
You really think he'd be on our side?

1129
01:16:31,046 --> 01:16:32,089
No.

1130
01:16:32,256 --> 01:16:33,548
I have an idea.

1131
01:16:33,715 --> 01:16:36,009
Me, too. Where's yours?

1132
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:38,011
Downstairs.

1133
01:16:38,178 --> 01:16:39,346
Where's yours?

It's about time we met.

1147
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:29,980
You've been getting my emails, right?

1148
01:17:30,188 --> 01:17:31,773
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

Regarding the...

1150
01:17:33,066 --> 01:17:34,210
You didn't even tell me about the grant.

1151
01:17:34,234 --> 01:17:35,878
- About the grant.
- The September Foundation.

1152
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:36,902
- Right.
- Yeah.

1153
01:17:36,945 --> 01:17:37,985
Remember when you applied?

1154
01:17:38,071 --> 01:17:39,114
Yeah.

1155
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:41,783
I approved, so now we're in business.

But you didn't tell me anything.
What's up with that?

You keeping secrets from me now?

1158
01:17:45,787 --> 01:17:49,583
I just know how much you love surprises
so I thought I would let you know...

1159
01:17:50,250 --> 01:17:51,752
Anyway, what did I apply for?

1160
01:17:51,918 --> 01:17:53,062
That's what I'm here to hash out.

01:17:53,086 --> 01:17:54,463
Okay. Hash it out, okay.

that she's someone's aunt.

involved or whatever? No?

- Sure.

for your grant...

That's you, right?

Um, no.

Wow! Nice catch.
3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour.

That's not easy. You got mad skills.

That's where you found that?

1188
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:00,588
Because you know that's all fake.

1189
01:19:00,612 --> 01:19:01,812
It's all done on the computer.

Mmm-hmm.

a really good day today, Mr Stark.

1207
01:19:46,950 --> 01:19:48,076
Nobody.

1208
01:19:48,452 --> 01:19:50,454
Not even your unusually attractive aunt?

1209
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:51,913
No. No.

1210
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:54,666
No! If she knew, she would freak out.

1211
01:19:54,833 --> 01:19:56,543
And when she freaks out, I freak out.

1212
01:19:56,835 --> 01:19:58,835
You know what I think
is really cool? This webbing.

1213
01:20:00,130 --> 01:20:02,507
That tensile strength is off the charts.

1214
01:20:02,591 --> 01:20:03,967
Who manufactured that?

1215
01:20:04,259 --> 01:20:05,469
I did.

1217
01:20:08,305 --> 01:20:09,556
Adhesive gloves?

1218
01:20:09,723 --> 01:20:11,016
It's a long story. I was...

1219
01:20:11,641 --> 01:20:13,852
Lordy! Can you even see in these?

1220
01:20:14,019 --> 01:20:15,020
Yes, I can.

1221
01:20:15,187 --> 01:20:16,354
I'm blind!

01:20:17,314 --> 01:20:18,899
I can see in those.

01:20:19,065 --> 01:20:19,900
Okay?

1224
01:20:20,066 --> 01:20:22,402
It's just that when whatever
happened, happened...

1225
01:20:22,486 --> 01:20:24,779
it's like my senses
have been dialled to 11.

so they just kinda help me focus.

1231
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:42,506
I gotta know, what's your MO?

01:20:42,589 --> 01:20:44,509

(STAMMERS)

1235
01:20:50,388 --> 01:20:52,349
Because I've been me my whole life,

1236
01:20:52,432 --> 01:20:54,100
and I've had these powers
for six months.

1237
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:55,727
Mmm-hmm.

1238
01:20:55,810 --> 01:20:58,188
I read books, I build computers.

1239
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:02,067
Yeah, I would love to play football,

1240
01:21:02,150 --> 01:21:03,750
but I couldn't then, so I shouldn't now.

1241
01:21:03,944 --> 01:21:05,445
Sure, because you're different.

1242
01:21:05,612 --> 01:21:08,532
Exactly. But I can't tell
anybody that, so I'm not.

1243
01:21:12,244 --> 01:21:16,540
When you can do the things
that I can, but you don't...

1244
01:21:18,959 --> 01:21:21,086
and then the bad things happen...

1245
01:21:21,836 --> 01:21:23,463
they happen because of you.

1246
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:30,720

you wanna do your part?

Make the world
a better place, all that, right?

I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg.

1251

(TONY EXHALES)

1252
01:21:56,830 --> 01:21:58,039
You got a passport?

1253
01:21:58,123 --> 01:21:59,642
No, I don't even have a driver's license.

1254
01:21:59,666 --> 01:22:01,126
- You ever been to Germany?
- No.

1255
01:22:01,209 --> 01:22:02,210
Oh, you'll love it.

1256
01:22:02,419 --> 01:22:04,337
- I can't go to Germany.
- Why?

1257
01:22:06,798 --> 01:22:08,008
I got homework.

1258
01:22:08,675 --> 01:22:10,594
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.

1259
01:22:10,844 --> 01:22:12,905
No, I'm being serious.
I can't just drop out of school.

1260
01:22:12,929 --> 01:22:14,049
Might be a little dangerous.

1261
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:16,257
Better tell Aunt Hottie
I'm taking you on a field trip.

1262
01:22:18,810 --> 01:22:20,645
Don't tell Aunt May.

1263
01:22:21,479 --> 01:22:22,564
All right, Spider-Man.

1264
01:22:26,192 --> 01:22:27,402
Get me out of this.

1265
01:22:27,569 --> 01:22:28,612
Sorry. I'll get the...

1267
01:22:41,541 --> 01:22:42,792
What is it?

1268
01:22:42,959 --> 01:22:44,377
Stay here, please.

1270
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:52,510
Guess I shoulda knocked.

01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:56,097
Oh, my God! What are you doing here?

1272
01:22:56,264 --> 01:22:58,558
Disappointing my kids.

1273
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:03,855
I'm supposed to go waterskiing.

1274
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:06,149
Cap needs our help. Come on.

1275
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,484
Clint!

1276
01:23:09,402 --> 01:23:10,695
You should not be here.

1277
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,282
Really?

1278
01:23:14,783 --> 01:23:17,869
I retire for, what, like five minutes,
and it all goes to shit.

1279

Please consider
the consequences of your actions.

1280
01:23:20,497 --> 01:23:21,497

1282
01:23:22,874 --> 01:23:24,376
Okay, we gotta go.

1283
01:23:28,755 --> 01:23:30,048
It's this way.

1284
01:23:30,507 --> 01:23:32,425

01:23:36,971 --> 01:23:38,473
You gotta help me, Wanda.

1287
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,493
Look, you wanna mope,
you can go to high school.

1288
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:42,560
You wanna make amends,
you get off your ass.

1289
01:23:43,561 --> 01:23:44,561
Shit.

(GROANS)

1291
01:23:51,152 --> 01:23:52,904
I knew I should've stretched.

1294
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:11,005
I know I can't.

1295
01:24:11,589 --> 01:24:13,174
But she can.

1296
01:24:14,718 --> 01:24:17,804
Vision, that's enough. Let him go.

1297
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:19,723
I'm leaving.

1298
01:24:19,848 --> 01:24:20,974
I can't let you.

1299
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,355
I'm sorry.

1300
01:24:30,859 --> 01:24:32,694
If you do this...

1301
01:24:33,153 --> 01:24:36,156
they will never stop being afraid of you.

1302
01:24:37,615 --> 01:24:40,952
I can't control their fear, only my own.

1303
01:24:53,173 --> 01:24:54,424
CLINT: Oh...

1304
01:24:56,342 --> 01:24:58,803
Come on. We got one more stop.

1305

1308

Move or you will be moved.

1309
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:16,571
As entertaining as that would be...

1310
01:25:16,738 --> 01:25:18,907
You really think you can find him?

1311
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,075
My resources are considerable.

1312
01:25:21,242 --> 01:25:23,620
Yeah, it took the world
70 years to find Barnes...

1313
01:25:23,703 --> 01:25:26,206
so you could probably do that
in about half the time.

1314
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,083
You know where they are.

1315
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:31,336
I know someone who does.

1316
01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:36,633
Not sure you understand
the concept of a getaway car.

1317
01:25:36,716 --> 01:25:37,717
It's low profile.

1318
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:41,095
Good, because this stuff
tends to draw a crowd.

1319
01:25:42,931 --> 01:25:44,432
Can you move your seat up?

1320
01:25:44,599 --> 01:25:45,725
No.

1321
01:25:45,975 --> 01:25:47,018
I owe you again.

Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too.

1325

1326
01:26:03,368 --> 01:26:04,368

1329
01:26:25,265 --> 01:26:26,182
Late.

1330
01:26:26,266 --> 01:26:27,266
Damn right.

1331
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:32,772
I should go.

1332
01:26:32,939 --> 01:26:33,940

if I had any other choice.

1336

01:27:16,691 --> 01:27:17,817

1345
01:27:22,864 --> 01:27:24,699

01:27:45,094 --> 01:27:47,180
I know you know
a lot of super people, so...

1354
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,974
thinks for thanking of me.

1355
01:27:50,224 --> 01:27:51,935
- Hey, man!
- What's up, Tic Tac?

1356
01:27:52,185 --> 01:27:53,186
Uh, good to see you.

01:27:54,938 --> 01:27:58,066
It was a great audition,
but it'll never happen again.

Something about
some psycho-assassins?

you're a wanted man.

Yeah, well, what else is new?

1364
01:28:10,536 --> 01:28:11,536
We should get moving.

Because the fight needed to be fought.

1981
02:14:08,208 --> 02:14:09,835
It's the same with these Accords.

1982
02:14:10,502 --> 02:14:14,005
I signed because it was
the right thing to do.
